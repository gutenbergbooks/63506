<br /><span class="h2line2">FLASH MESSAGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Only ten more minutes, Jack, and we&rsquo;ll be off
duty. That gives us just time enough to get to the
Scout meeting by seven o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll be glad to call
it a night too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick Washburn yawned as he lowered a powerful
field glass through which he had scanned the
sky for a glimpse of aircraft.</p>
<p>He and Jack Hartwell, a companion Boy Scout
and Explorer, were nearing the end of a two hour
trick at the Civilian Defense observation tower. Few
planes had passed overhead and there had been no
activity to break the monotonous vigil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it hasn&rsquo;t been so tough,&rdquo; returned Jack cheerfully.
He was a lean, friendly youth, deeply tanned
because he had spent practically all of his spare
hours out-of-doors. &ldquo;Our work is needed here as a
protection against unexpected enemy attack. I&rsquo;m
glad to help, even if it is tedious to perch on this
tower platform.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kicking,&rdquo; said War. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.
These observation posts are necessary to cover gaps
in our radar system. Only I wish more planes would
pass over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like an enemy attack, or at least a little
mystery and intrigue,&rdquo; chuckled Jack. &ldquo;That trip we
made to Peru gave you a taste for adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did at that,&rdquo; the other agreed. &ldquo;After weeks
of exciting life in the wilds, Belton City seems a bit
tame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Particularly this observation post?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been reporting the movement of
planes for several months now, Jack. I sure wish a
little excitement would come our way again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re looking in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warwick stared at his friend, surprised by the
remark. &ldquo;The wrong direction?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;What
d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack relieved him of the field glass, focussing it
on the entrance road of a nearby cemetery. The
tower platform also offered an unobstructed view
of the Pablo Automobile plant adjoining the burial
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; War asked as his chum remained
silent. &ldquo;Any ghosts moving around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that old automobile again,&rdquo; Jack reported.
&ldquo;This makes four times in the last month that I&rsquo;ve
seen it turn into that cemetery road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that car on the brain, boy!&rdquo; War
scoffed, losing interest. &ldquo;Forget it and stick to airplanes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jack agreed, again training the glass on
an expanse of sky. &ldquo;All the same, it strikes me as
queer that the car keeps coming back time after
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For weeks, Jack had amused fellow members of
Explorers Post 21 by his constant reference to a
mysterious automobile.</p>
<p>Not only had he called attention to it repeatedly,
but he had noted down the license number, LC
1478. The car was a seven-year old model, driven
by a man who wore workman&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>Jack had pointed out that the car always appeared
at the cemetery entrance just at dusk or a
trifle later. Furthermore, the driver nearly always
parked close to the main highway, proceeding
through the trees afoot.</p>
<p>Where he went the Scouts never had learned, for
foliage blocked their view. But after ten to twenty
minutes, he always reappeared and drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m going to check up on that
fellow&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began, but War interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>A plane was passing the observation tower, high
overhead. Instantly alert, the Scouts determined its
altitude and type. Jack went quickly inside to send
an aircraft flash message to the filter center.</p>
<p>His telephone contact established, he received the
terse &ldquo;Air Defense, go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Single&mdash;multi-jet&mdash;very high&mdash;&rdquo; Methodically,
Jack went on to complete the message, and hung up
immediately after he heard the operator&rsquo;s clear,
&ldquo;Check, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The task completed, he rejoined Warwick on
the breezy platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our relief&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; War remarked, indicating
two men who were walking briskly toward the observation
tower. &ldquo;We may as well take off for the
Scout meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the newcomers had arrived, the Scouts
started at a fast pace for the Belton Methodist
Church where the meeting of Explorers Post 21 was
to be held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step on it,&rdquo; urged Jack. As crew leader, he made
a point of never being tardy for a session.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m practically running now,&rdquo; Warwick complained,
hard pressed to keep up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rush?
Anything important coming up at tonight&rsquo;s meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to talk over that canoe trip to Minnesota.
It was postponed when our gang went to Peru
instead, but this time it&rsquo;s all set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; War said pessimistically.
&ldquo;Something may come up. I&rsquo;ve got one of those dark
brown feelings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your feelings!&rdquo; Jack retorted with
a grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The pair arrived at the church only three minutes
late. Willie Medaugh, a tow-headed youngster of
15, and Ken Dougherty, a serious high school senior,
already were in the recreation room which had been
fitted up for Scout use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Jack greeted his friends. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Hap?&rdquo; He
referred to George (Happy) Livingston, a former
FBI man who directed Scout activities in Belton
City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here yet,&rdquo; replied Ken. &ldquo;He telephoned that
he&rsquo;d been held up. We&rsquo;re to go ahead with the meeting.
He&rsquo;ll be along later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what came for him,&rdquo; Willie said, pointing to
a thick, slightly soiled envelope which had been
placed conspicuously on the table. &ldquo;Mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder why the letter was delivered here instead
of to his office?&rdquo; Jack commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it had no street address,&rdquo; Willie informed
him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s directed it care of the Belton
Methodist Church. So the postman brought it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a load of that foreign stamp!&rdquo; exclaimed
War, fingering the envelope. &ldquo;Colombia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask Hap if I can have it after he&rsquo;s
finished with the letter,&rdquo; announced Willie, who
collected foreign stamps. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d be writing him
from South America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut out the speculation, and let&rsquo;s get on with the
meeting,&rdquo; urged Jack. &ldquo;Shall we start off with the
Four Freedoms ceremony? I want to run through it
to be sure we have it down pat before we invite our
folks to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Forgetting the letter, the other Explorers settled
down to the business of the evening. Willie brought
four candles and the American flag which were to
be used in the ceremony.</p>
<p>Jack assigned Bob MacDonald, a new organization
member to act as narrator. Standing behind the
flag, the red-headed youth recited slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This flag represents the past, the present and the
future. The stripes stand for the original thirteen
colonies. The stars represent the present states. The
Explorers represent the men of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, only put more feeling into it, Jack
advised. Especially that part about Explorers being
the men of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob repeated the lines to the satisfaction of the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; boomed a voice from the doorway.
Unobserved, Mr. Livingston had come into the
meeting room. He added seriously: &ldquo;Here in America,
the Four Freedoms do exist, but at times we&rsquo;re
inclined to take them for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s the best country in the world,&rdquo; declared
War. With a quick change of subject, he went
on: &ldquo;Say, Mr. Livingston, a letter came for you!
From Columbia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scout leader accepted the mail, studying both
the stamp and the handwriting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to open it?&rdquo; War demanded
impatiently. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Mr. Livingston smiled and ripped open the soiled
envelope. As he unfolded the closely written pages,
a small, hard, cotton-wrapped object dropped to
the floor.</p>
<p>Jack stooped to pick it up. His fingers closed over
a sizeable green stone. He stared in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;An emerald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others studied the gem which he held up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chunk of green glass,&rdquo; insisted Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Willie,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston corrected him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s a real emerald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Willie,&rdquo; the Scout leader soberly confirmed.
&ldquo;This letter and the gem are from an old friend of
mine. Give me a moment to scan his message, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 2</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MAN OF MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>Their curiosity whetted by sight of the green
stone, the Scouts eagerly waited as Mr. Livingston
skimmed through the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; he remarked when he had
finished reading. &ldquo;This is from Appleby Corning, an
old college classmate, now an engineer in Colombia.
The emerald is a sample from the Last Chance
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a sample!&rdquo; Jack commented. &ldquo;Is the mine
in Colombia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, not too far from Bogota. Appleby believes
that the Last Chance can be made to produce handsomely
for her American lessees. But he seems to
have run into difficulties. He writes that a former
manager, McClellan Rhodes, has caused him
trouble. He needs help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of help?&rdquo; inquired Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter is vague. Appleby just says he wants
me to fly down there to look over the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants you to join him in Colombia?&rdquo; Willie
repeated, his voice fading. &ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, if I can. He offers to pay all expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>A deep silence had fallen upon the little Explorer
band. Only too well, the Scouts knew that if Mr.
Livingston accepted the offer, their canoe trip to
Minnesota might again be postponed.</p>
<p>Yet no one could deny that a plane journey to
Colombia offered a thrilling prospect. Fresh in the
memory of all the Explorers except Bob, was the
recollection of a wonderful adventure shared with
their leader in Peru.</p>
<p>Not many months earlier, the Scouts had been assigned
to search for a missing explorer. Their mission
to a lost Inca city had been a highly successful
one, resulting in great honor for Post 21.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colombia sounds great!&rdquo; exclaimed War. Half
jokingly, he demanded: &ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Livingston regretfully.
&ldquo;Appleby says nothing about the Explorers. I don&rsquo;t
suppose he could provide passage for the entire
group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only kidding,&rdquo; War said at once. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
expect to be taken along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Livingston?&rdquo; Ken inquired
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve given it no thought, as yet. If I could
take you fellows along, I might be tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Colombia like?&rdquo; Willie asked with quick
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;A rugged country with many unexplored areas.
Bounded on the north by the Caribbean sea and
Venezuela. On the east by Venezuela and Brazil;
on the south by Brazil, Peru and Ecuador, and on
the west by the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been studying an atlas,&rdquo; Jack remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colombia always fascinated me,&rdquo; the Scout leader
confessed. &ldquo;Bogota is the capital city. The Magdalena
River traverses the entire country and provides
the chief means of transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a dandy opportunity for you,&rdquo; Ken
said. &ldquo;All expenses paid too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning is one of my best friends, though I&rsquo;ve
not seen him in years. I know he wouldn&rsquo;t call on me
if he weren&rsquo;t in a bad spot. He&rsquo;s capable of handling
any ordinary situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he send the emerald?&rdquo; War asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To snare my interest, I suspect. He says the mine
is one of the world&rsquo;s richest, but that the vein will be
lost if it can&rsquo;t be promptly worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he mean by that?&rdquo; asked Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t explain. He merely instructs me to
cable acceptance of his offer and take the first plane
to South America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell. Jack busied himself putting away
the record books. No one spoke of the projected trip
to Minnesota. Mr. Livingston himself brought up
the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised I&rsquo;d go with you on the jaunt,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go back on that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hold you to it,&rdquo; Ken said instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; added Jack. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be
fair. Why, a chance like this comes only once in a
lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go, if I could take you fellows with me. Say,
that gives me an idea! I&rsquo;ll cable Appleby Corning
tomorrow and outline the situation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he might include us in the invitation?&rdquo;
War asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible. But as I said, I doubt Appleby
would be able to finance the trip. Plane fare is no
small item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts soberly agreed. Not many months
earlier, Albert Monahan, a wealthy citizen of Belton,
had paid the way of the Explorers to Peru
where they successfully had traced his long-missing
brother. A trip to Colombia, however, was a different
matter. They could not expect Mr. Monahan or
anyone else to provide passage money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll forget it,&rdquo; Jack said carelessly. &ldquo;But you
must seize the chance, Mr. Livingston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, it will do no harm to send that
cable,&rdquo; the Scout leader said, smiling. &ldquo;Something
may turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>For the remainder of the evening, the Explorers
attended to routine business matters. All discussion
of the proposed trip to Minnesota carefully was
avoided. The Explorers knew that they might make
the excursion alone or with another adult, but the
prospect of having an outing without Hap left them
completely cold.</p>
<p>Later, after the meeting had adjourned, Jack and
Ken talked over the matter as they walked home
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Hap will accept the offer?&rdquo; the latter
speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we urge him enough, he will,&rdquo; Jack replied
gloomily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only his conscience that&rsquo;s holding
him back. He figures he owes us a duty. We&rsquo;ve postponed
our canoe trip so many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t stand in his way, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t, Ken. We&rsquo;ll convince him somehow
that he should go. Golly! I sure wish we could make
the trip with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably we could, if we could raise the dough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be simple!&rdquo; Jack replied with a short
laugh. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t earn enough for plane fares if
we saved our cash for a year. This trip is immediate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless, I guess,&rdquo; Ken agreed with a shrug.
&ldquo;No use thinking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the two Explorers were within view
of the observation tower where they had spent so
many hours on duty.</p>
<p>Instinctively, they raised their eyes to the platform.
Jack waved and whistled, but in the semi-darkness
of the street, the man who was in service
there, did not see him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The two went on, approaching the old cemetery
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your friend!&rdquo; Ken announced with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of mystery.&rdquo; Ken jerked his thumb toward
a battered car which had passed them only to
pull up just inside the entranceway of the cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this makes the second time tonight that bird
has been here!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, stopping short.
&ldquo;What brings him here so often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve asked that question enough times. Why
don&rsquo;t you learn the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jack echoed, impressed by the suggestion.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never have a better chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a distance, the two Explorers had seen the
driver of the car alight. Leaving the car parked just
off the road, he started afoot through the dark, deserted
cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow him,&rdquo; Jack proposed. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; agreed Ken with a grin. &ldquo;We probably
won&rsquo;t learn anything worth while, but it may put an
end to those doubts that have been percolating in
your brain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 3</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRANGE ACTIONS</span></h2>
<p>Keeping out of view, Ken and Jack followed the
stranger from a discreet distance. Unaware that he
was being trailed, the man walked swiftly along the
lonely cemetery road.</p>
<p>Once as he passed a street light, the two Explorers
caught a fleeting glimpse of his face. They gained
an impression of an individual with a large, flat nose
and square jaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see him before?&rdquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in that car,&rdquo; Ken replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tough
looking egg. He might give us a rough time if he
catches us trailing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, the two fell farther back.
It was well that they took the precaution, for unexpectedly,
the man paused and glanced back into the
darkness.</p>
<p>Ken and Jack froze. They remained motionless,
and after a moment, the stranger went on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! That was a close call,&rdquo; Jack muttered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be more careful than ever now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this bird going anyhow?&rdquo; Ken demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>His interest had heightened, for the one they
followed, had left the winding cemetery road. Walking
fast, he cut through the trees, avoiding the area
where tombstones had been erected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently, he doesn&rsquo;t come here to visit any of
the graves,&rdquo; Jack observed.</p>
<p>To avoid losing sight of the stranger, the Explorers
quickened their own pace. Suddenly, Ken placed
a restraining hand on Jack&rsquo;s arm. They both halted.</p>
<p>Ahead, only dimly visible, they could see that the
one they pursued, had halted beside a wooden barrier
fence.</p>
<p>For an instant, they thought that the man intended
to climb over.</p>
<p>Instead, he walked along the barrier for a short
distance. Then, squatting down, he began to dig in
the soft earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; Ken muttered in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for something that&rsquo;s been buried, I&rsquo;ll
bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two watched, the man suddenly ceased
digging. Apparently satisfied, he replaced the thin
layer of dirt he had removed, and covered the area
with leaves.</p>
<p>Then, he started back through the woods the way
he had come. Ken and Jack barely had time to secret
themselves behind trees before he passed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going back to his car now,&rdquo; Jack predicted,
after the man had disappeared in the darkness.
&ldquo;What do you make of it, Ken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here several times before. We know
that. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s under those leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going on to the fence, the Explorers quickly
cleared a small area to locate the spot where the
stranger had dug.</p>
<p>Jack removed a little dirt with his bare hands.
&ldquo;Wish I had a shovel or a spade!&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that fellow has a pet buried here,&rdquo; Ken
suggested.</p>
<p>Jack straightened up, knocking dirt from his
hands. &ldquo;You would shatter the illusion!&rdquo; he accused.
&ldquo;I was figuring on bringing up a box of gold. Enough
to take us to Colombia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is planted here is down deep,&rdquo; Ken
said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t bring it up without some tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s trot home then and get &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, Jack. Anyway, why not cut the other
fellows in on the fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Explorers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, why keep a good thing like this to ourselves?
War in particular would get a big boot out
of digging up something&mdash;even if it proves to be
only a dead cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jack agreed reluctantly, &ldquo;but maybe
whatever is buried won&rsquo;t be here by tomorrow.
We&rsquo;re taking a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very big one. We know that bird comes
at night ever so often. It strikes me, he doesn&rsquo;t come
to dig anything up, but only to make certain it&rsquo;s still
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;A treasure, maybe! Or
loot from a robbery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we should notify the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we find out what&rsquo;s here first,&rdquo; Jack
proposed. &ldquo;As you say, it may prove to be a buried
cat or nothing of importance. We&rsquo;d be the laughing
stock of Belton in that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm to wait a day,&rdquo; Ken willingly
agreed. &ldquo;If anything is buried here, it&rsquo;s been
under ground for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the fellows together tomorrow,&rdquo; Jack
proposed. &ldquo;Say, I have an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spill it, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s invite &rsquo;em all to a hike, and advise &rsquo;em to
bring spades. Then we&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em here, and see
what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right to me,&rdquo; Ken nodded, replacing
dirt over the area disturbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to
get in touch with the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully, the two Explorers removed all evidence
of their digging work. Before leaving the area,
they covered the ground with leaves.</p>
<p>When they reached the cemetery road a few minutes
later, the parked car was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad I jotted down that driver&rsquo;s license
number,&rdquo; Jack remarked, as he and Ken walked on
toward their homes. &ldquo;Who knows? It may come in
handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discovery of mysterious activity in the cemetery
deeply interested both Scouts. Eager to learn
if anything valuable had been buried by the fence,
they lost no time in contacting the other members
of the Rovers unit.</p>
<p>However, to make the hike more alluring, they
refused to pass out even a hint of what might be in
store. Jack not only telephoned Warwick, Willie and
Bob, but also called Mr. Livingston. The Scout
leader said regretfully that he would be tied up at
his office and could not accompany them on the
afternoon hike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going far anyhow,&rdquo; Jack assured him.
&ldquo;If anything develops, I&rsquo;ll get in touch with you
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By pre-arrangement, the Rovers met at the entranceway
to the cemetery the following afternoon
at 3:30 p.m. Ken and Jack were to have the remainder
of the day and the evening to themselves, for it
was not a date on which they were assigned to the
observation tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you ask us to meet you here?&rdquo; War demanded,
as he joined the waiting group. Following
instruction, he had brought a spade. &ldquo;Want me to
dig a grave or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own!&rdquo; Jack retorted. &ldquo;Everyone here?
Where&rsquo;s Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coming up the street now,&rdquo; Ken reported. &ldquo;Look
at the size of that knapsack he&rsquo;s carrying! Filled
with food, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably figures we&rsquo;re going on a three-day
hike,&rdquo; Jack chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are we going?&rdquo; Willie demanded curiously.
&ldquo;A couple of miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about a thousand yards, more or less,&rdquo; Ken
returned carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand yards!&rdquo; Willie fairly shrieked. &ldquo;You
call that a hike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you tell us to bring spades?&rdquo; War
asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do a little digging,&rdquo; Jack said
with a grin. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Ken guided the other three through the
cemetery to the barrier fence adjoining the automobile
plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X marks the spot,&rdquo; Ken chuckled, indicating the
area he and Jack had investigated the previous
night. &ldquo;Dig, slaves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo; Willie probed. &ldquo;Why all
the mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and what are we expected to bring up?
Oil?&rdquo; demanded War. &ldquo;Not a spadeful will I turn
over until you tell us what we&rsquo;re supposed to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh, Jack related the manner in which
he and Ken had followed the mysterious stranger
on the previous night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s that fellow in the old car!&rdquo; War
scoffed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been talking about him for a month,
Jack. So finally you make something of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack may have been smarter than the rest of us,&rdquo;
Ken said soberly. &ldquo;After watching that bird last
night, we&rsquo;re convinced something has been buried
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to cut us in on the hard digging?&rdquo;
War joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea,&rdquo; Ken grinned. &ldquo;Get
busy! I&rsquo;ll post myself down by the road to watch for
that car driver. He&rsquo;s not likely to show up here at
this time of day, but it&rsquo;s well to be alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see anyone coming, whistle twice,&rdquo; Jack
advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. If you hit anything interesting, give the
same signal. I want to be on hand when the chest
of gold is raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; War murmured with relish. &ldquo;Pieces of
eight! Say, wouldn&rsquo;t it be swell if we would dig up
money! We could make that trip to Colombia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be your age!&rdquo; Jack scoffed. &ldquo;If money has
been buried here, just remember it belongs to someone
else. Not us. Here, give me that spade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; War insisted, starting to dig. &ldquo;This is
my pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>For ten minutes, the Explorers clustered about as
their chum dug steadily. The ground was relatively
soft, encouraging them to believe that it had been
disturbed not many weeks earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; Jack suddenly warned War. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
struck something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent down to examine the metal object which
protruded. It appeared to be the handle to a kettle
or other heavy container. However, it was so deeply
embedded, that even with Bob&rsquo;s help, he could not
raise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig some more,&rdquo; he advised War. &ldquo;Be careful
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ken ought to be here,&rdquo; Willie remarked, gazing
toward the cemetery road. &ldquo;Shall I call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Jack nodded. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve hit the
treasure or whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie wet his fingers and blew two shrill blasts.
Promptly, an answer was received. A few minutes
later, Ken came running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo; he demanded breathlessly.</p>
<p>By this time, War had removed more dirt. &ldquo;An
iron kettle,&rdquo; he reported, resting for a moment on
his spade. &ldquo;Loaded to the brim with emeralds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been thinking of emeralds ever since that
one came for Mr. Livingston!&rdquo; Ken laughed. &ldquo;What
is in the kettle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; War admitted. &ldquo;Being nice
guys, we waited for you before we peeked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not wait any longer,&rdquo; Jack urged impatiently.
&ldquo;Remember, we have no guard now, and
time&rsquo;s slipping by pretty fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; agreed Willie. &ldquo;The owner of this little
kettle may come back. So let&rsquo;s lift &rsquo;er out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s inside,&rdquo; Jack insisted.</p>
<p>The lid of the kettle had been wired down. With
the aid of a Scout knife, he was able to untwist it.
As the other Explorers huddled expectantly about
the hole, he slowly and ceremoniously raised the
cover.</p>
<p>A sudden silence ensued, to be followed by a howl
of disappointment.</p>
<p>The kettle contained several pint milk bottles
filled with a colorless liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold! Emeralds!&rdquo; Willie warbled. &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but water,&rdquo; War added in disgust. &ldquo;All
that work for nothing! Jack, you and Ken certainly
were taken for a ride this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken had bent down again to sniff at the liquid in
one of the bottles. Straightening, he gazed wide-eyed
at his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff isn&rsquo;t water,&rdquo; he told them tersely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too heavy. Furthermore, it has a peculiar odor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, if it isn&rsquo;t water?&rdquo; asked War. He
started to pick up one of the containers. Ken seized
his arm, shoving him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; War demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch that stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s nitro-glycerin! At least I think it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nitro,&rdquo; War echoed, looking scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough to blow us all to Kingdom Come!
We&rsquo;re lucky we haven&rsquo;t set it off with the careless
way we&rsquo;ve been digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here fast!&rdquo; War said, starting
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just go off and leave the stuff,&rdquo; Jack
protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do,&rdquo; Ken advised. &ldquo;Two
of us will have to remain here on guard. The rest
can go for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment. All the Explorers
had a healthy respect for nitro-glycerin, a powerful
explosive. Under certain conditions, even a slight
jar would be sufficient to set it off. If the liquid still
were active, there was quantity enough to destroy
the nearby automobile plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; Jack quickly volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sticking too,&rdquo; insisted Willie. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t argue.
There&rsquo;s no time to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Jack grimly agreed. He turned to Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take War and Bob and hot-foot it to the nearest
telephone. Willie and I will stand guard, but we
have no craving to meet the Angels. So tell those
cops to step on it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 4</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SURPRISE CACHE</span></h2>
<p>Left to themselves, Willie and Jack took up the
vigil near the kettle of fluid believed to be nitro-glycerin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this stuff is still active, it&rsquo;s a miracle it hasn&rsquo;t
been set off,&rdquo; Jack remarked, pacing nervously along
the fence. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s enough explosive here to
blow that automobile plant to smithers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us too, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Nitro&rsquo;s mighty tricky stuff. I hope Ken, War
and Bob get those cops here in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed when Willie
thought he heard a car on the nearby cemetery road.
As they listened intently, it halted some distance
away and the motor was switched off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be a police car,&rdquo; Jack decided, becoming
worried. &ldquo;Ken would have brought the cops
closer. Anyway, the fellows haven&rsquo;t had time enough
to get help here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be that bird in the ancient auto coming
back again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I was thinking,&rdquo; Jack agreed. Scanning
the nearby trees, he noticed a cluster of dense
bushes which offered a fairly promising hiding
place.</p>
<p>As he was considering the possibility of seeking
refuge in an emergency, Willie suddenly exclaimed:
&ldquo;Jack, someone is coming this way from the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s that same fellow!&rdquo; Jack observed, pulling
his friend toward the bushes. &ldquo;Quick! He hasn&rsquo;t seen
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Scouts took cover. Although the screen
of foliage was a thin, unsatisfactory one, the stranger
who approached, seemed too intent upon his
thoughts to glance in that direction.</p>
<p>Jack and Willie obtained a clear view of the man.
He was about forty-five years of age, short and
carelessly dressed in working clothes. A billed cap
was pulled low over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he&rsquo;s the same one who&rsquo;s been coming here
so often?&rdquo; Willie whispered. &ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll have
to warn him not to get near that kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the same one,&rdquo; Jack answered grimly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
going straight to the fence too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, the stranger, noticing that dirt had been
disturbed by the barrier, stopped short. He uttered
a muffled exclamation, and then went on.</p>
<p>The Scouts saw him bend down to gaze at the exposed
kettle, and carefully raise the lid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his nitro!&rdquo; Jack asserted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s live stuff
too! See how careful he is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The stranger turned unexpectedly, surveying the
area with alert eyes. Jack and Willie remained motionless.</p>
<p>But the workman had noticed footprints in the
soft earth near the fence. His gaze followed an indistinct
shoe pattern directly to the clump of bushes.</p>
<p>Almost before the two realized that they had been
detected, he whipped out an automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out o&rsquo; there!&rdquo; he ordered, moving slowly
forward. &ldquo;With your hands up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Willie silently obeyed. One glimpse
directly into the face of the sullen stranger convinced
them that he would tolerate no delay. His
dark eyes had a wild look which unnerved them
more than the barrel of the automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you boys doing here?&rdquo; the stranger
demanded harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, n-nothing,&rdquo; Willie answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dug up that kettle by the fence, stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we did?&rdquo; Willie retorted. &ldquo;Nothing in it
anyhow, except water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; the one with the revolver echoed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to be alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s nitro?&rdquo; Jack asked quietly. &ldquo;Why did
you bury it by the fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I have done with it? Carry it
around in my pocket? I&rsquo;d like to get rid of the stuff,
but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dump it in the creek,&rdquo; suggested Willie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
one running through the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are stupid!&rdquo; the stranger accused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know nitro is heavier than water? It would sink
to the bottom and form a layer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notify the police,&rdquo; advised Jack. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workman glared at him. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said sarcastically,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll know what to do all right! You
kids give me a pain! You never should have come
poking around here. That stuff would have been
okay if you&rsquo;d left it alone. Now I&rsquo;m in a spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get the nitro in the first place?&rdquo; Willie
questioned.</p>
<p>The stranger did not reply. His face twisted with
worry, he ordered the Scouts to start walking toward
the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you taking us?&rdquo; Jack asked, moving as
slowly as he dared.</p>
<p>He could sense the man&rsquo;s uncertainty, and was
stalling for time. If only Ken, War, Bob and the police
would arrive!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do with you,&rdquo; the stranger
admitted. &ldquo;If I let you go, you&rsquo;d blab about the nitro.
I&rsquo;ve got to move it, but where, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we talk this over?&rdquo; Jack suggested.
&ldquo;Maybe we can work out something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? What? I don&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo; Scowling, the
stranger paused as he came to a cemetery bench. He
sat down, but kept his automatic trained on the two
Scouts who remained standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re afraid to go to the police, why not let
us do it for you?&rdquo; Jack proposed.</p>
<p>The workman looked momentarily interested, but
shook his head. &ldquo;No soap. The nitro would be traced
to me. Besides, I may have a use for that soup later
on. It&rsquo;s valuable stuff&mdash;too valuable to be thrown
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous though,&rdquo; Jack suggested, lowering his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; the stranger ordered sharply. &ldquo;No
tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack continued to talk, though he scarcely heard
his own words. From the roadway he had caught the
hum of a motor. A police car perhaps? If so, the
officers had avoided using a siren, which would have
been a dead give-away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; the stranger asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Car going through the cemetery,&rdquo; Jack answered
with a shrug. &ldquo;You sure are nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be too, if you&rsquo;d nursemaided ten pints
of nitro for six months! I can&rsquo;t sleep nights for worrying
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve kept coming back here so
often?&rdquo; Willie inquired. He could hear a slight rustle
of leaves and thought that someone must be moving
afoot through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the man admitted. &ldquo;I had to make certain
the stuff was okay. It would have been too, if you
kids had kept away. I could wring your necks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with us?&rdquo; Jack asked,
trying desperately to hold the full attention of the
stranger.</p>
<p>By this time, he and Willie had glimpsed Ken,
War and Bob walking near the fence. The man with
the revolver could not see them, for he sat with his
back to the approaching Scouts.</p>
<p>Jack and Willie were certain a car had stopped
closeby in the cemetery, but there was no sign of the
police. They were worried too, lest at any moment
their three chums might betray their presence. If
only they would catch on to the situation!</p>
<p>Deliberately, Jack began to argue in a louder tone,
hoping his voice would carry to the fence. To his relief,
he saw Ken turn to gaze toward the bench.
Quickly, he shifted his own gaze lest his intense interest
alert his captor.</p>
<p>Moments passed. Then as Jack and Willie remained
with hands raised, they heard a soft rustle of
leaves. Their friends were stealing up behind the
park bench!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take you with me,&rdquo; the stranger suddenly
announced, his mind made up. &ldquo;Get going! To
the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Willie turned as if to obey. At that moment,
as their captor started to arise, the other
Scouts closed in from behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Before the man could resist, they overturned the
bench, toppling him to the ground. The automatic
was discharged harmlessly into the air. Jack seized
and held the man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by numbers, the stranger found
himself powerless to move. Ken, Bob and Willie
used the overturned bench to hold him pinned to the
earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Get the police!&rdquo; Ken urged. &ldquo;Their car is
down the road. We came on ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no need for anyone to seek assistance.
The revolver shot had brought the police on a
run. A moment later they came up to take charge of
the captive. Unprotesting, he allowed them to lock
handcuffs onto his wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, boys!&rdquo; one of the officers praised.
&ldquo;Do you know this guy you&rsquo;ve nailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts admitted that they had no idea as to
his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Blackie Williams, an expert safe cracker,&rdquo;
they were informed. &ldquo;He did a long stretch at the
state penitentiary. Got out about a year and a half
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner was escorted to the police car. While
he remained under guard, one of the officers went
with the Scouts to inspect the cache of nitro-glycerin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the real stuff,&rdquo; the policeman announced
after a brief examination of the liquid in the kettle.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough here to blow up the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still active?&rdquo; Jack questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;It probably is. This stuff is too tricky to be moved
by anyone except a nitro expert. You Scouts were
lucky you weren&rsquo;t blown to bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Jack admitted ruefully. &ldquo;We had no
idea what was in the kettle when we started digging.
Luckily, our spade never jarred the container.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a job getting rid of that nitro,&rdquo;
the policeman said. &ldquo;The important thing now is to
bottle up this area, so no one gets hurt. You boys
willing to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Warwick agreed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then post yourselves along the cemetery road,&rdquo;
the policeman instructed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone in. If
that nitro should let loose, this whole place would
go up in one loud bang!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 5</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HEROES ALL!</span></h2>
<p>Within an hour after the capture of Blackie Williams,
the Belton newspapers carried front page accounts
of the nitro-glycerin discovery. Photographers,
reporters and hundreds of curious persons
swarmed to the cemetery area.</p>
<p>Working under direction of police, the Scouts
guarded entrance roads until relieved of duty. Reporters
interviewed them and photographers insisted
that they pose for action shots. To their intense embarrassment,
townsfolk chose to regard them as
heroes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, we didn&rsquo;t do much,&rdquo; Ken protested. &ldquo;If
anyone deserves credit, Jack does. He had that first
hunch about Blackie Williams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A policeman informed the Scouts that an out-of-town
explosives expert would be called in to set off a
controlled explosion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked to Blackie, and there&rsquo;s no question
the stuff is active,&rdquo; he told Jack. &ldquo;Too dangerous to
move. It seems he stole it seven months ago from an
explosives plant. Once he got his hands on it, he
realized he had more than he could use in twenty
years. So he had to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts were on hand the following day when
a nitro-glycerin expert arrived to inspect the kettle
of fluid. He told police the explosive could not be
safely moved and that it must be detonated. Preparations
went forward for the big blast.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Bradley Graham, an expert,
sod and screenings were placed atop the cache
to control the explosion. A two-pound dynamite
charge, activated by a battery-powered switch, then
was set up.</p>
<p>When all was in readiness, great crowds jammed
the streets, approaching as close as police would
allow. Only newspaper reporters and Scouts were
permitted within the roped off area. All were warned
to hit the ground face downward at the moment of
the explosion.</p>
<p>The signal was given. Mr. Graham pulled a switch.
But for a moment, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dud&mdash;&rdquo; War muttered.</p>
<p>His words were drowned by a mighty explosion
which rocked the earth. Dirt and crushed stone flew
high into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dud, eh?&rdquo; said Jack laughing, wiping dust from
his clothes as he got quickly to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>After an interval, the Scouts were permitted to inspect
the great crater which had been made. The
hole was fully fifteen feet across and nearly five feet
deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess a little knowledge comes in handy,&rdquo; Bob
remarked in awe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure lucky we recognized that
stuff as nitro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts thought no more of the incident.
Therefore, it came as a distinct surprise, when on the
following day, they received word that a recognition
dinner was to be given in their honor. Explorers
Post 21 members were instructed to present themselves
at the Belton Hotel at six o&rsquo;clock on Friday
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to go?&rdquo; Willie asked Mr. Livingston
in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; the Scout leader advised. &ldquo;The mayor
and the president of the auto plant are giving the
dinner. You boys performed a fine service, so it&rsquo;s
only right that Belton should show appreciation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their consciences at ease, the Scouts pressed their
green Explorers&rsquo; uniforms and at the designated
hour presented themselves at the hotel. Two hundred
businessmen and their wives had turned out to
honor the boys.</p>
<p>The dinner was excellent and high praise was bestowed
upon the Scouts. As a climax, the mayor
arose to announce that citizens of Belton City wished
to show their appreciation in a more material way.
In behalf of the entire Post, he handed Jack a check
for $900.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Jack glued his eyes on the bit of paper, too overcome
to speak. He felt Ken nudge him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say something, you lug!&rdquo; his chum urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In behalf of my fellow Explorers&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began,
&ldquo;I want to say that we&rsquo;re most grateful.&rdquo; He laughed
and dropped the formality. &ldquo;Oh, heck! We only did
what every Scout is supposed to do&mdash;his duty. We
didn&rsquo;t want pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you didn&rsquo;t, Jack,&rdquo; responded the
mayor. &ldquo;Nevertheless, we feel that the Scouts performed
a great service. Had it not been for your
alertness, the automobile plant might have been destroyed.
So take the check and spend it as you wish&mdash;a
vacation trip or new furniture for your club
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jack murmured, grinning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll manage
to spend it all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the gathering had broken up, the Explorers
joined Mr. Livingston to discuss their good fortune.
Jack turned the check over to the Scout leader, who
said he would deposit it at the bank the first thing
the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a night it&rsquo;s been!&rdquo; Willie remarked blissfully.
&ldquo;With all this dough, we really can have a
bang-up trip to Minnesota&mdash;if we go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The Scouts gazed speculatively at Mr. Livingston.
Since the arrival of the letter and emerald from his
friend in Colombia, he had not even mentioned the
subject again. Had he given up all thought of making
the trip, they wondered?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said abruptly, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
intended to spill this just yet, but I may as well. I&rsquo;ve
accepted Appleby Corning&rsquo;s offer. I hope to leave
for Colombia within three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one replied for a moment. The information
was most disappointing.</p>
<p>Ken was the first to find tongue. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
fine,&rdquo; he said in a hollow tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss you, but
it&rsquo;s a splendid opportunity. Post 21 won&rsquo;t be the
same without you, but we&rsquo;ll get along somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said anything about getting along without
me?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston demanded with a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re taking us with you!&rdquo; cried
War, his freckled face crinkling into lines of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea. I cabled my friend, and
received a reply this morning. He said to bring you
fellows along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the cost?&rdquo; Jack interposed anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the rub,&rdquo; admitted the Scout leader. &ldquo;Appleby
isn&rsquo;t too well off. He&rsquo;s offered though, to pay
all the plane fares, round trip. All other expenses of
the trip would have to be met by us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would nine hundred dollars do it?&rdquo; War asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have another hundred or so we&rsquo;ve saved for
the Minnesota trip,&rdquo; added Willie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for shooting
the works!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the mayor presented the check tonight, I
couldn&rsquo;t see how the trip might be financed,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston admitted. &ldquo;But with plane fare furnished,
I think we could get along. Once we&rsquo;re in Colombia,
Mr. Corning will put us up at the Last Chance mine.
So we&rsquo;ll have no living expenses there. Naturally,
we&rsquo;ll need a little extra money for emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; War chortled. &ldquo;Why wait
three weeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little item of school for one thing,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston reminded him. &ldquo;Also, your parents must
consent. Talk the matter over with them and report
to me tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the following day, all the Scouts with exception
of Bob, had obtained permission to make the
journey. His parents felt that he was too young to
attempt such a long trip. Instead, they were taking
him with them on a motor tour to California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t mind too much,&rdquo; Bob cheerfully
informed his friends. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a softie, but those
tales you told about being held captive by Indians in
Peru left me rather cold. I&rsquo;m partial to a nice bed
and three square meals a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a different sort of trip,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t expect to become mixed up in an intrigue over
Inca gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be emeralds this time,&rdquo; Bob predicted.
&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s brewing or Mr. Corning wouldn&rsquo;t have
sent for Hap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; Jack agreed with a grin.
&ldquo;Trouble certainly has developed at the Last Chance
mine. And it&rsquo;s a cinch we&rsquo;re going to be in the thick
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 6</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A COMPANY AGENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the place. A filthy looking little
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston had paused before a doorway on a
shadeless, rather depressing back street of Cartagena.
Only a moment before, a carriage had deposited
the Scout leader and the four Explorers at
an address where they hoped to obtain information
concerning Appleby Corning.</p>
<p>The day was uncomfortably warm. Since arriving
eighteen hours earlier at the Caribbean port, the
Scouts had waited expectantly at their hotel.</p>
<p>No word had come from Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s friend,
the mining engineer, who had promised to meet and
personally escort them to the Last Chance mine
above Emerald Valley in the eastern Andes.</p>
<p>Learning that the company which controlled the
emerald mine, had a Cartagena as well as a Bogota
office, the Scouts finally had set out to find the
former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the company office all right,&rdquo; Jack Hartwell
confirmed, consulting an address scribbled in
his notebook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;In we go,&rdquo; the Scout leader urged.</p>
<p>He led the way into the untidy quarters of the
Bolton Mining Company offices. The outside room
in which the Explorers found themselves was both
deserted and dusty. Old magazines and mining journals
cluttered the tables and chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; Warwick remarked uneasily.</p>
<p>Ken, however, crossed the room to an inner doorway
which opened into another office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;Good
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were addressed to a man, who sat half-hidden
behind a battered, roll-top desk. He wore
no coat or necktie and had not shaved that day.</p>
<p>Seeing Ken in the doorway, the agent&rsquo;s feet came
down from the desk where they had been resting.
His mouth dropped open to expose unclean, broken
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Ken repeated pleasantly. &ldquo;Are
you the agent for the Bolton Mining Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; the man growled. &ldquo;Who are you?
What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unprepared for such an indifferent reception, Ken
stepped aside so that Mr. Livingston and the other
Scouts could enter. The company agent regarded
them with obvious annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo; he demanded again as
no one spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is George Livingston,&rdquo; the Scout leader
introduced himself. &ldquo;You probably know why I am
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat taken aback by the agent&rsquo;s blunt reply,
Mr. Livingston introduced Ken, Jack, Willie and
Warwick. The mining company man merely stared
at them with complete lack of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Ferd Baronni?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired,
as the agent failed to introduce himself. He had
been informed at the hotel as to the company representative&rsquo;s
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You got business with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleby Corning didn&rsquo;t tell you we were coming
to Colombia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen Corning in three months. And if I
don&rsquo;t see him for another three, it will be soon
enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston ignored the remark. &ldquo;Mr. Corning
agreed to meet us here,&rdquo; he told the agent. &ldquo;It seems
there&rsquo;s something wrong at the Last Chance mine,
and he wanted us to help him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always trouble at the mine,&rdquo; Ferd Baronni
growled. He eyed the Scout leader suspiciously.
&ldquo;What did he send word to you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corning didn&rsquo;t explain. He merely forwarded
plane fares and asked us to come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Corning paid your way here? I always knew that
guy was half crazy and this proves it! What does he
figure you can do to get the mine on a paying basis?
You an engineer, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a Boy Scout leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agent&rsquo;s thin lips parted in a hard, mirthless
smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a big help!&rdquo; he said sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! You&rsquo;ll never be able to stand the climate at
the Last Chance. It&rsquo;s a lot colder than Bogota. I advise
you to climb back on a plane and return to the
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking for information, not advice,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said pleasantly. &ldquo;Do you know when Mr.
Corning is likely to get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know more about it than I do,&rdquo; the agent
shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the representative of the company,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but Corning&rsquo;s comings and goings ain&rsquo;t
none of my affair. It&rsquo;s my job to ship out the emeralds.
Lately, there ain&rsquo;t been any to ship.&rdquo; The agent
smiled in grim satisfaction. &ldquo;If you want it straight,
your friend has fallen down on the job. He came
here talking big&mdash;oh, he was going to clean up the
mess at the Last Chance&mdash;get the cooperation of the
workers, and open up a big vein! What&rsquo;s he done?
Failed like they all do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve handled company affairs for quite a
while, I take it?&rdquo; the Scout leader questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve years. Part of the time I&rsquo;m at the Bogota
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us a little about the Last Chance mine,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to tell. Emerald mining is a government
monopoly here, but an American outfit got a concession.
The best emeralds in the world are found in
Colombia.&rdquo; For the first time, since the Scouts had
met him, Mr. Baronni showed enthusiasm. &ldquo;The
Last Chance has been worked off and on before the
coming of the Spaniards. But the mine&rsquo;s playing out.
Since your friend Corning took over, production has
dropped alarmingly. Any day now I expect to get
word from the company to close down completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds rather discouraging,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
commented. &ldquo;What seems to be the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle the Indians.
They steal him blind. Another thing, the mine is
playing out. It&rsquo;s up to him to find another vein of
emeralds, and find it quick. The former engineer
should have been left in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston eyed the agent thoughtfully, but
made no comment. It had been apparent from the
first, that Ferd Baronni had no love for Appleby
Corning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see some emeralds?&rdquo; the agent invited,
pulling himself reluctantly from a swivel chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>From an old-fashioned safe, he removed a cigar
box. Almost reverently, he fingered a handful of
large emeralds contained within. One which he offered
Mr. Livingston was soft to the touch, very
dark in color and had smoldering fire.</p>
<p>Another, somewhat smaller, was a shade lighter.
Instead of having a subdued glow, it seemed to blaze
with flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this one&rsquo;s a first quality emerald,&rdquo; the agent
informed the awed group. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t getting many of
&rsquo;em any more from the Last Chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the mine is likely to close down?&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any day now. Then the workers will drift off to
find work elsewhere. Once a mine shuts down, vegetation
takes over. That&rsquo;s how so many once-rich
veins have been lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corning didn&rsquo;t tell you we were coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cables I think, came through here. Or perhaps
they were sent by way of Santa Marta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the big banana shipping port. Corning has
friends there. Your message to him still may be there
uncollected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he knew we were coming,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said in a worried voice. &ldquo;He promised to meet us
here at Cartagena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it wasn&rsquo;t Santa Marta or Bogota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. We wouldn&rsquo;t make a mistake as
stupid as that. How can we get word to him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; the agent replied indifferently. &ldquo;When
Corning gets around to it, if he ain&rsquo;t too busy, he
may drop down to Santa Marta. Or maybe to Bogota.
Lately, he&rsquo;s been sending his emeralds to the
office there&mdash;when he has any to send, which ain&rsquo;t
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get word to the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no railroad. Only a mule track. My advice
is to see Cartagena and if he doesn&rsquo;t show up in a
few days, take a boat back to the States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agent&rsquo;s advice was most discouraging to the
Scouts. After talking with Baronni for a while longer,
they gloomily returned to their hotel to think over
the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe Appleby would let us down,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston told the Explorers. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get word to us
soon. Meanwhile, we may as well do a little sightseeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any too much cash,&rdquo; Ben reminded
the group. &ldquo;In making our plans, we figured on Mr.
Corning putting us up at the mine. If we run a fancy
hotel bill here for a week or so, it will make quite a
dent in our funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleby will show up within a couple of days,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston insisted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With time heavy upon their hands, the four Explorers
thoroughly explored the delightful port of
Cartagena. They visited the old reservoir, the ancient
walls, the harbor and the fine residential section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>But after three days of leisurely sightseeing, the
Scouts wearied of the quiet old city. Each morning
they called upon Ferd Baronni to ask if any word
had been received from Appleby Corning. Each day,
the answer was in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better forget about the Last Chance mine,&rdquo; the
agent advised them gruffly. &ldquo;You can catch a boat
tomorrow for the States. After that, there won&rsquo;t be
another for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston shook his head. &ldquo;Mr. Corning sent
for us. I&rsquo;m unwilling to return without at least making
an effort to contact him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; the agent shrugged. &ldquo;You got a
long wait ahead probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lose any more time. I&rsquo;ve practically
decided to go on to the Bogota office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baronni straightened in his swivel chair. &ldquo;Some
company officials live there, but the office is closed
most of the time,&rdquo; he informed the Scout leader. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re dead set on pulling out of here, you&rsquo;d have a
better chance of learning about your friend at Santa
Marta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. How do we get there? Can you help
us, or shall we make arrangements ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Ferd Baronni gazed steadily at Mr. Livingston a
moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the arrangements, if you&rsquo;re determined
to go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I got a friend who runs a
sled boat between here and Calamar. When you get
there you can take a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be at the dock tomorrow at seven,&rdquo; the agent
advised, writing an address on a slip of paper.</p>
<p>The Scouts thanked him for his trouble, and went
back to the hotel to pack. Their spirits soared at the
prospect of leaving Cartagena. At dinner however,
Jack noticed that Mr. Livingston was unusually
quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid we may not find Mr. Corning at
Santa Marta?&rdquo; Jack guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thought does bother me. It&rsquo;s a little out of
our way in going to the mine. Another thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jack asked as the Scout leader
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m borrowing trouble, I guess. But I can&rsquo;t help
wishing I hadn&rsquo;t allowed Ferd Baronni to make our
travel arrangements. He seemed too eager to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston admitted. &ldquo;He dislikes
Appleby Corning. Furthermore, he&rsquo;s resented
our mission here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that. We could cancel the arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The Scout leader considered for a moment, then
shook his head. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll let them stand,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of my suspicions. The sled-boat
trip should prove to be an interesting diversion. I&rsquo;m
looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 7</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TOIL AND TROUBLE</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Livingston and the Explorers presented themselves
at the dock promptly at seven o&rsquo;clock the following
morning.</p>
<p>They were to proceed by way of a natural channel
connecting the Magdalena River with the sea. The
propeller boat in which they were to ride already
was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer looking contraption,&rdquo; Ken remarked upon
inspecting it.</p>
<p>The sea-sled was approximately thirty feet in
length, motor-powered, and with curious runners. A
canopy was provided as protection from the sun, and
there were comfortable wicker chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we ready to start?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired
cheerfully after the luggage had been placed aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the operator answered.</p>
<p>He was a young Colombian, dark-haired and with
an extremely nervous manner.</p>
<p>The Scouts took their places in the sled-boat and
waited. Fifteen minutes passed, and finally a half
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why the delay?&rdquo; Jack finally asked, walking over
to the boat operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for another passenger,&rdquo; the man answered
curtly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of service is this, anyhow?&rdquo; Willie
grumbled. &ldquo;This late passenger must be a mighty
important guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another twenty minutes elapsed while the Scouts
grew increasingly impatient.</p>
<p>Finally, the one for whom they waited, arrived at
the dock. A handsome woman of forty, dressed in a
white linen suit, came hurriedly to the sled-boat.
Porters carried her luggage, and a number of boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, she must be the wife of an official or something!&rdquo;
Warwick whispered to Jack. &ldquo;She had her
nerve holding us up nearly an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; the other warned him. &ldquo;You want her to
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman spoke briefly with the operator of the
sled-boat, whose name the Scouts now knew to be
Haredia. They conversed so rapidly in Spanish that
Jack could not understand, despite some knowledge
of the language. However, he saw the pair glance
twice in the direction of the boat, and had an uneasy
feeling that the Scout party was under discussion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Presently, the woman came aboard, accepting the
chair which Mr. Livingston offered her. She scrutinized
each of the Scouts and sat down without
mentioning her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m George Livingston,&rdquo; the Scout leader introduced
himself, intending to be friendly.</p>
<p>A roar of the powerful boat motor drowned out
his words. The woman merely inclined her head
slightly in acknowledgement of the introduction and
made no answer.</p>
<p>The Scouts settled back into their chairs expectantly.
A great fountain of spray was thrown up as
the boat glided smoothly over the water on her long
runners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is great!&rdquo; War cried, thoroughly enjoying
himself. &ldquo;Just like a toboggan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the bay, the boat shot out into the open
Caribbean sea and presently slowed down to enter
a passageway leading to a marshy lake.</p>
<p>The sled continued to skim along between banks
dense with tropical growth. Jack stole a glance at
the woman passenger. She showed no interest in the
scenery, and in fact, appeared bored. From her indifference,
he concluded that she had made the trip
on prior occasions and that the experience no longer
interested her.</p>
<p>Without slackening speed, the sled raced on past
villages of thatched huts. Only when they reached
a great marsh, did the operator throttle the motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Anxiously, he studied the many bays and inlets
which were heavily clogged with water-hyacinths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo; Ken murmured, as Haredia
tried first one and then another of the openings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s searching for a passageway through,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston explained. &ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t clog the
propeller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sled proceeded, the way became more difficult.
Hyacinths were floating everywhere in dense
masses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ve taken the wrong channel,&rdquo; Willie
muttered. &ldquo;Haredia should turn back before we&rsquo;re
hemmed in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never will,&rdquo; Ken replied. &ldquo;Not that bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For no reason that the Scouts could explain, they
had taken a dislike to the operator of the sled boat.
Haredia had not been hostile, but he had coldly
ignored them. Though he had handled the boat
skillfully enough in open water, it seemed to them
that now that the going had become harder, he was
abandoning all caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting into those hyacinths deeper and
deeper,&rdquo; Jack remarked uneasily. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we
turn back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing over his shoulder, he was rather dismayed
to see an almost solid meadow of water
plants behind the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be easy to get lost in this mess,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;But I suppose Haredia knows what he&rsquo;s
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The sled kept stubbornly on, its laboring engines
cutting a passage.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the motor set up a frightful clatter
and the boat began to move in jerks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it now!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;The motor&rsquo;s
shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston left his chair and went over to see
what he could do to help. Haredia, nervous and perspiring,
brushed aside his offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me now!&rdquo; he rasped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out
of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, if you use your head,&rdquo; the Scout leader
replied. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t keep on without ruining the
motor. It sounds to me as if the clutch has slipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo; Haredia demanded
savagely. &ldquo;Fix it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a place where we can put in for repairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do better to go on, if we can find the channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not lost,&rdquo; Haredia insisted irritably. &ldquo;With the
motor running right, I could find the channel in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we pole out of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be hard work,&rdquo; the operator tried to discourage
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Nevertheless, he brought out the long poles and
the Scouts took turns shoving the heavy boat backwards
through the thick, choking mass. A hot sun
beat upon them, causing perspiration to run down
their foreheads and legs.</p>
<p>As they toiled, the woman passenger showed
little interest. Remaining under the shade of the
canopy, she fanned herself and calmly read a magazine.</p>
<p>The Scouts began to feel annoyed as the sun rose
higher and the poling became harder. They expected
no help from their fellow passenger, but her
utter indifference to their toil rather nettled them.</p>
<p>As for Haredia, he divided his time between
steering the craft and smoking cigarettes. Not once
did he grasp a pole to exert any physical effort.</p>
<p>Getting out of the worst of the hyacinth net, the
Scouts tried several inlets which offered promise.
None led to open water.</p>
<p>Haredia was able to move the boat slowly now
by means of the crippled motor. But stretches of
clear going were few and far between. For the
greater part of the time, the Scouts were forced to
pole. Their hands became blistered and their backs
sore.</p>
<p>By dint of exhausting work, they finally brought
the boat to an area of sparse hyacinth growth. Three
passages opened before them. Haredia steered toward
one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the other opening,&rdquo; Jack proposed. &ldquo;It
looks less clogged with plants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Haredia acted as if he had not heard. Jack repeated
the suggestion. Still there was no response.
The other Scouts had stopped poling, allowing the
boat to drift.</p>
<p>Haredia started to turn on the disabled motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Jack said tersely. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk this over. You
admit you&rsquo;re lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will find the passage in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one looks the same as another.&rdquo; Jack went
on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a process of elimination&mdash;trying them
one at a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s try the other passage first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haredia glowered at Jack. &ldquo;This one is better,&rdquo;
he insisted.</p>
<p>The woman passenger had laid aside her magazine.
She spoke firmly. &ldquo;Haredia is right. We must
follow his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack knew he was beaten. Actually, in appearance,
there was little choice between the passageways.
He was ready to give in to Haredia&rsquo;s wishes
when Ken nudged him and pointed.</p>
<p>A native in a dugout canoe had just emerged from
another inlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should be able to guide us to a village if we
can make him understand!&rdquo; Ken asserted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
give him a yodel!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>To the obvious displeasure of both the woman
and Haredia, Jack shouted to the native. He came
readily, gazing in awe at the crippled boat.</p>
<p>Haredia spoke rapidly to him. Jack caught a few
of the words and the native&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says we&rsquo;re to take this passage,&rdquo; Haredia
translated, pointing to the one he had favored.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s eyes smoldered. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said coldly,
&ldquo;but I happen to understand a little Spanish. You
didn&rsquo;t ask him how to reach the nearest village. You
said something about the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this!&rdquo; Haredia said furiously.
&ldquo;Maybe the Senor would like to take charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack glanced questioningly at Mr. Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, we will,&rdquo; the Scout leader replied. Quietly,
he instructed Jack: &ldquo;Try to make the native understand
that we want him to guide us to the nearest
village or plantation. Tell him we&rsquo;ll pay well for the
service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 8</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DELAY</span></h2>
<p>When Haredia understood that Mr. Livingston
and the Scouts were determined to question the native,
his attitude abruptly changed. He spoke again
to the man in the dugout, who nodded and gestured
in the direction Jack had suggested that they take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Indian will guide us,&rdquo; Haredia informed the
passengers. &ldquo;He says we are to follow him. With
your permission, senor, I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an insolent manner, the boat operator bowed
to Mr. Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems we were right about the passageway,&rdquo;
the Scout leader replied. &ldquo;How far is the nearest
village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a plantation on about a quarter of a
mile,&rdquo; Haredia returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aided by the racking motor, the sled boat moved
by spurts through the hyacinths. The Indian, naked
to his waist, paddled ahead, indicating every turn
in the maze.</p>
<p>Gradually, the mat of entangling hyacinths
thinned out and they saw the main channel ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;This looks more like it,&rdquo; Jack sighed, putting
away the poles.</p>
<p>The disabled motor presently brought them to the
wharf of a large plantation. While Haredia and Mr.
Livingston attended to getting repairs, the Scouts
sat in the shade and sipped cool drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure Haredia,&rdquo; Willie remarked, swatting
an insect. &ldquo;Was he trying to pull a fast one on
us, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to lose one&rsquo;s way in a field of
hyacinths,&rdquo; War returned. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t blame him for
that, although one would think he&rsquo;d know the
route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was stubborn about wanting to take that
other inlet,&rdquo; Willie went on reflectively. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d
followed his advice, we&rsquo;d be poling yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought too much about it, except
that he clearly didn&rsquo;t want that native to guide
us here,&rdquo; contributed Ken. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Happy insisted
upon staying at the dock while repairs are
being made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hap won&rsquo;t let him pull anything,&rdquo; Jack declared
confidently. Draining his glass of limeade he arose
and stretched his legs. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll amble down to
the wharf to see how the work&rsquo;s going. Maybe I
can help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Bored by inactivity, Ken decided to accompany
him. Leaving Willie and War to finish their drinks,
the two sauntered down to the wharf where the sea
sled had been raised out of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what became of our female passenger?&rdquo;
Jack remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she went to the plantation house,&rdquo; Ken answered
indifferently. &ldquo;I hope she stays there too.
She&rsquo;s a cool number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but I aim to,&rdquo; Ken announced. &ldquo;Maybe
this is my chance now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haredia was coming up the path, eating a sandwich
of sardines. He would have avoided the pair
had not Ken stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the work coming along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the boatman told him briefly. &ldquo;The
clutch is fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be starting soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rudder is bent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; Ken commented. &ldquo;How long
will we be held here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haredia shrugged. &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Maybe an hour. Maybe three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit hard on the lady,&rdquo; Ken commented,
seeing an opening. &ldquo;By the way, what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not know,&rdquo; Haredia returned stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and she seemed well acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Senora has traveled on my sled boat once
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not ask as many questions as the American
Scouts,&rdquo; the boatman retorted with an unpleasant
smile. &ldquo;You will pardon me now? I have an errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed them and went on up the path to the
thatched roof plantation house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was telling us, I guess,&rdquo; Jack laughed shortly.
&ldquo;We were being rather inquisitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfriendly not to give one&rsquo;s name. Anyway,
you can bet little Haredia knows who she is, but he&rsquo;s
keeping it dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would he do that, Ken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Jack. Maybe she&rsquo;s the wife of a big
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, would that be any reason for keeping
her name a secret? She knows Haredia well. What&rsquo;s
more, she supported him when he deliberately chose
the wrong route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may have been a natural mistake. He&rsquo;s supposed
to know his business, while we&rsquo;re unfamiliar
with the waterways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Jack acknowledged, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t like the
way they kept looking at each other, as if they were
pulling some trick. Haredia can&rsquo;t be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he ever gets us to the Magdalena, we&rsquo;ll be free
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Jack frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;For the
life of me, I can&rsquo;t see why he&rsquo;d try to delay us. But
that&rsquo;s what he seems to have done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may have misjudged him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Ken, Ferd Baronni made the arrangements
for our trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying Baronni may have messed up our
journey on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hits me that way, Ken. I&rsquo;ll admit though, I
can&rsquo;t figure out any logical reason he&rsquo;d have for not
wanting us to go on to find Appleby Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of Mr. Livingston. He reported that repairs on the
sled boat should be completed in another hour or
two. The delay, however, would put them a day
behind in their schedule.</p>
<p>The Scout leader was inclined to brush aside
Jack&rsquo;s theory that Haredia and Ferd Baronni might
have conspired together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Haredia is an irresponsible
fellow with an ugly disposition. He took a dislike
to our party and is being most uncooperative. I
question though, that he and the company agent
have any close connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haredia tried to delay us by choosing the wrong
passageway,&rdquo; Jack pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His attitude, I think, resulted from inefficiency.
He was unwilling to admit a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said, for just then the boatman sauntered
back from the plantation house. Mr. Livingston
joined him and they returned together to the
wharf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Jack and Ken watched the repair work for awhile,
but there was nothing they could do to help. The
intense heat presently drove them to shade.</p>
<p>As they flicked mosquitoes, Mr. Ferendez, the
genial plantation owner, came up with Warwick and
Willie. The three struck up a friendly conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ferendez has been telling us about Santa
Marta,&rdquo; Willie asserted, munching a banana. &ldquo;He
says it&rsquo;s situated on a good harbor, and has weekly
steamers to New York and New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big banana center, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Ken remarked
to make conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exports have increased enormously,&rdquo; Mr. Ferendez
told him. &ldquo;You should have an interesting visit
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not on a pleasure trip,&rdquo; War disclosed.
&ldquo;The fact is, we&rsquo;re on our way to the Last Chance
mine, and are going by way of Santa Marta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Last Chance mine! You&rsquo;re heading into the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Ken were flashing War warning signals,
considering it unwise to reveal their plans, even to a
friendly stranger. The younger Scout, however,
failed to take the hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Emerald Valley,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Appleby Corning,
the engineer at the mine, sent for us. He was
supposed to meet us at Cartagena, but didn&rsquo;t. So
we&rsquo;re going on to the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why go by way of Santa Marta?&rdquo; the plantation
owner asked with a puzzled frown. &ldquo;Bogota is
considered the gateway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we might run into Mr. Corning at
Santa Marta. He&rsquo;s supposed to have friends there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plantation owner made no comment. His very
silence, however, troubled the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Mr. Corning?&rdquo; Jack finally inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him, but he seldom travels this way.
I understand he&rsquo;s been kept very busy at the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble there?&rdquo; questioned Willie.</p>
<p>The planter smiled. &ldquo;So long as I can remember,
there&rsquo;s been trouble at the Last Chance. Wherever
you find emeralds, you&rsquo;ll find intrigue and grief. If
you&rsquo;re going there, I advise you to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful?&rdquo; echoed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mule trail to the mine is dangerous. That
section of country, you know, is overrun with bandits.
Carlos in particular, has a reputation for holding
up mule trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping Mr. Corning will meet us at Santa
Marta,&rdquo; War said. &ldquo;Or at least send word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, what became of the former engineer
at the Last Chance?&rdquo; Ken inquired thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Did he return to the States?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The planter revealed his astonishment. &ldquo;The engineer&rsquo;s
wife could answer that question better than
I,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;His wife?&rdquo; Ken repeated. &ldquo;Where would we
meet her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You already have,&rdquo; the planter answered in
amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that woman passenger on the
sea sled!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed incredulously. &ldquo;The one
who didn&rsquo;t tell us her name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Mrs. McClellan Rhodes, wife of the engineer.
Her first name is Rosie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye fishes!&rdquo; Willie yipped in sudden apprehension.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;s going to the mine
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the planter. &ldquo;Rosie
didn&rsquo;t say. But if she is heading for Emerald Valley
and the mountains, her husband must now be at the
mine. And in that event, your friend, Mr. Corning,
had better be alert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disturbed by the planter&rsquo;s remarks, Jack and his
friends tried to learn more. Mr. Ferendez could tell
them very little.</p>
<p>He related that he had met McClellan Rhodes
and his wife only once before, at Bogota. At that
time they were mingling in society, living high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes didn&rsquo;t attend to his duties at the mine, I
was told,&rdquo; Mr. Ferendez reported. &ldquo;According to
rumor, he was replaced because of inefficiency. Under
Appleby Corning, the mine has improved. But
apparently, there&rsquo;s dissatisfaction among the emerald
miners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think Rhodes may have something to do
with it?&rdquo; inquired Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;d like to get his old job back,&rdquo; the planter
returned. &ldquo;No question about that. He and his wife
made a good thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Rhodes now?&rdquo; asked Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask his wife,&rdquo; the planter responded,
inclining his head toward the path. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts had no intention of questioning Mrs.
Rhodes. It annoyed them though, that they had not
learned her identity earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What stupes we&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; Willie remarked after
the woman had passed them on her way to the
wharf. &ldquo;We talked about the mine and our plans in
front of her! She just kept her lips buttoned and
listened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t learn much from us,&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows who we are, and where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mystery about that, Willie. Now that
we&rsquo;ve learned she&rsquo;s Mrs. Rhodes, we can be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, Mr. Livingston called the Scouts, beckoning
them to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready to shove off,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;With
luck, we may reach Calamar tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the Scouts took their places in the
boat. The halt seemingly had improved Haredia&rsquo;s
disposition for he appeared almost cheerful as the
craft again sped through the waterway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes paid no attention to the Scouts. Even
when War, in an attempt to be friendly, pointed out
an unusual bird, she merely nodded.</p>
<p>Night came on. Banana groves and mango trees
lost detail, merging into an indistinct shoreline. No
longer could the Explorers see the thatched-roof
huts as their craft raced along.</p>
<p>Everyone was relieved when at last the boat
reached the wide Magdalena river, and ultimately
Calamar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston announced.
&ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll proceed by boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As their craft made dock, the Scouts stiffly arose
and gathered their luggage. Willie tried to help Mrs.
Rhodes, but she ignored his hand as she stepped
ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he mumbled politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye?&rdquo; she repeated, with the faintest trace
of a smile. &ldquo;Oh, I rather think we shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Santa Marta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There or elsewhere.&rdquo; With a hard, mirthless
laugh, Mrs. Rhodes turned and walked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 9</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">OFF COURSE</span></h2>
<p>For the next few days, the Scouts saw no more of
Mrs. Rhodes. Upon their arrival at the banana port
of Santa Marta, they were disturbed to learn that
Mr. Corning had failed to send any message for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a mix-up somehow,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said, deeply worried. &ldquo;Appleby couldn&rsquo;t have received
word from me, or he&rsquo;d have met us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;Go on to the
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t hear from Appleby within a day or
two, it&rsquo;s all we can do, Jack. Our money won&rsquo;t
stretch too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the Scouts ran into Mrs. Rhodes in the
hotel dining room. They saw her again the next day
at breakfast, and later at a large banana plantation
which they visited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is she trailing us, do you think?&rdquo; Jack speculated,
noting the woman&rsquo;s presence among a throng
of tourists at one of the banana sheds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gave you that idea?&rdquo; Ken scoffed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she showed up at our hotel, didn&rsquo;t she?
And she&rsquo;s more or less been around ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Santa Marta&rsquo;s small, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know. I wouldn&rsquo;t think anything of it if
I didn&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s the wife of that deposed engineer.
But War told me she was quizzing him this
morning after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of questions did she ask, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems she was trying to find out if we
were dead set on going on to the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so suspicious about that?&rdquo; Ken asked,
turning his head away as the woman under discussion
glanced in his direction. &ldquo;It might be natural
curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Jack conceded, &ldquo;only Mrs. Rhodes
doesn&rsquo;t hit me as the curious type. When she asks a
question, she&rsquo;s after information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did War tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. He figured she was pumping him, so
he gave her double talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Explorers forgot Mrs. Rhodes as a guide
appeared to conduct them through the banana
groves. Somewhat to their relief, the woman did not
join the sightseeing party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Grassy lanes intersected the plantations, stretching
as far as the Scouts could see. The giant plants
were spaced fifteen feet apart, and rose to a height
of nearly forty. Except for the droning, monotonous
voice of the guide, a great stillness prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, what a forest of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; War murmured in
awe. &ldquo;A fellow could get lost here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go wandering around,&rdquo; Jack warned him.
&ldquo;Stick close to the guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts kept together on the main cart road
and in the lanes which seemed to stretch endlessly.
With keen interest, they watched the cutting of
green bananas.</p>
<p>Workers went in twos, a cutter and a backer,
equipped with a long pointed stick and a sharp
machete.</p>
<p>The cutter would stick the banana plant below
the bunch, so that it toppled slowly down within
reach of the backer, who promptly shouldered it.</p>
<p>With swift strokes of the sharp machete, the
cutter then severed the bunch from the plant. Off
trotted the backer with his heavy burden, to deposit
it along the card road. Bunches were protected from
the sun with green banana leaves.</p>
<p>Wearying of the guide&rsquo;s lengthy description of
how bananas were harvested, Jack and War returned
to the cart road to await the sightseeing
party there.</p>
<p>Seating themselves on a mat of cut banana leaves,
they watched as a worker with a cart gathered the
deposited bunches and rattled off out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>War became absorbed in watching tiny lizards
which darted everywhere. &ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t it about time
our gang got back here?&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>He arose and Jack trailed after him. But when
they peered down the long row of banana plants
where their party had been, no one was to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d everyone go?&rdquo; Jack asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have gone into another row. A good
joke on us! We&rsquo;d better find &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking quickly along the cart road, the two
Scouts looked down one long green lane after another.
Their friends were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d they get away so fast?&rdquo; Jack murmured,
annoyed at himself for having missed the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sat by the roadside a lot longer than we
realized, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not really lost,&rdquo; Jack asserted. &ldquo;We
can follow this cart road back to the shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; War agreed, &ldquo;but we may not hit the right
shed without a lot of hunting. Hey, listen! I think I
hear someone talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing, the two became attentive to the sounds
about them. A humming bird whirred by and there
came the throaty croak of a frog from a nearby irrigation
ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anyone&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began, only to check
himself. &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>The inaudible words reached his ears only as an
indistinct, blurred flow of speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;That must be our guide!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Catch
the direction, War?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; his companion directed, starting
down one of the grassy lanes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Jack called, but War, impulsive as
always, paid no heed.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the older Scout hastened to catch up
with his friend.</p>
<p>War, finding he had made a mistake in entering
a deserted row, cut through to an adjoining lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, wait!&rdquo; Jack called, thoroughly annoyed.</p>
<p>Even then, War did not pay attention to the command,
if indeed he heard it. Now far ahead of his
friend, he kept moving from row to row, trying to
follow the elusive murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Finally, perspiring heavily, he halted to catch his
breath and listen again. Jack then caught up with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea?
Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To find our gang. I thought they&rsquo;d be in this
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve chased through a half dozen of &rsquo;em. I
can&rsquo;t even hear voices now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>War listened a moment. &ldquo;Neither can I,&rdquo; he acknowledged
uneasily. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve missed our
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get back to the cart road and make
for the shed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; War agreed, crestfallen.</p>
<p>They started back through the lane, trying to retrace
the way they had come. Rows of arching
banana plants marched endlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all mixed,&rdquo; War presently confessed.
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be coming to the cart road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me we&rsquo;ve walked far enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this row we&rsquo;re following doesn&rsquo;t intersect
the road where we came in,&rdquo; War said, struck by a
sudden, unpleasant recollection. &ldquo;Before we started
out this morning, I was looking at a map that hung
in the main shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the rows bisect at right angles. But at
one point, the road curves around. The rows at that
place, just go straight on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far, War?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it looked as if some of them extended the
length of the plantation&mdash;miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! You think we&rsquo;ve hit one of those rows,
War?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it. We&rsquo;ve walked a long distance
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack paused, his eyebrows pulling together in a
worried frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we lost?&rdquo; War asked, nervously wiping perspiration
from his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Jack grinned reassuringly. &ldquo;Not lost,&rdquo; he corrected.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temporarily off course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, War. Now let&rsquo;s sit down a minute
and think this thing through. There must be an easy
way out of this fruit garden, and we&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 10</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BANANA PLANTATION</span></h2>
<p>Jack and War were more annoyed at themselves
than alarmed by their situation.</p>
<p>Common sense told them that although the plantation
was an extensive one, they eventually would
reach a loading shed where directions could be obtained.
The worst they would suffer would be inconvenience
and delay.</p>
<p>However, they realized that by this time their
friends would have missed them. Their failure to be
on hand would prevent the others from returning
to the hotel for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving too,&rdquo; War announced with chagrin.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of this steam bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just sit still and think for a change!&rdquo; Jack
scolded him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming you, because I was
equally at fault. But if we&rsquo;d used our heads, instead
of chasing off in pursuit of a voice, we wouldn&rsquo;t be
here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do? Sit and wait for someone to find
us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could, but it would waste a lot of time. The
bananas in this particular row are only half developed.
So I imagine a cutter won&rsquo;t be coming this
way for days or weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, we survive on raw lizards and green
bananas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to be serious, War. We&rsquo;re bound to cause
Hap and the gang a lot of trouble if we don&rsquo;t find
the group fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do except start walking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is, we&rsquo;ve got to figure out a sensible
route&mdash;just moving from row to row at random
won&rsquo;t get us to the cart road unless we&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we retrace our way? We can follow our
own prints, I reckon. But it will take an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end it probably will save time,&rdquo; Jack declared,
getting up from the mat of banana leaves.
&ldquo;If we miss our own trail, we still have the sun to
guide us. It was at our back when we started this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determinedly, the Scouts returned the route they
had come. Memory of small, almost unnoticed
things, now aided them. Jack recalled a pile of dried
banana plant leaves they had passed just after
changing rows. War remembered seeing the rusty,
broken blade of a discarded machete.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a full half hour elapsed before the
two Explorers finally emerged at the narrow cart
road. No one was in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still lost&mdash;off course, I mean,&rdquo; War said
in discouragement. &ldquo;What do we do now that we&rsquo;re
back where we started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to find a loading shed,&rdquo; Jack decided. &ldquo;No
use chasing through the banana rows searching for
our party. By this time, Hap and the fellows probably
have gone back to the entrance gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncertain which direction to go, the Scouts stood
a moment in the blazing sun. Just then an empty
oxen cart rattled down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes our private limousine!&rdquo; War chuckled.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hitch a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the cart jogged by, the Scouts hailed the
driver. He understood no English, but Jack in halting
Spanish succeeded in conveying the idea that
they wanted to ride to the loading shed. The workman
motioned for them to climb in.</p>
<p>The floor of the cart was padded with the thick
fiber of old banana stalks. Jack and War sat in the
back, swinging their legs over the edge. The vehicle
bounced along, stopping at intervals to pick up
bananas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reckon he understood your Spanish, Jack?&rdquo;
War asked as the trip dragged on. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll
spend the afternoon bouncing along over this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; the other agreed philosophically. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
it better than walking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Only I&rsquo;d like to get out of here fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, War,&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll roll in
after our driver picks up a few more bananas. Patience,
my lad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they jounced along, the Scouts kept an alert
watch for their missing friends. But in the long plant
rows, they saw only occasional workmen.</p>
<p>Presently, the little cart, now two-quarters filled
with banana bunches, bounced over a log bridge
which spanned a ditch. Seeing the big loading shed
and a railroad siding beyond, the Scouts leaped off
their perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the ride,&rdquo; Jack called to the cart
driver. &ldquo;<i>Gracias, Senor.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workman responded with a friendly wave of
his hand.</p>
<p>Wilted by the noonday heat, Jack and War
walked toward the shed adjoining the railroad
tracks. Through the open door they could see rows
of green banana bunches stacked ready for shipment
to the boat dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty,&rdquo; War announced, wetting his lips.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can find some drinking water. I
could go for a nice iced cocoanut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find it here,&rdquo; Jack rejoined. &ldquo;Or an ice
cream soda either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the doorway of the banana shed, he abruptly
halted, his attention fixing upon two persons who
were inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; he whispered to War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Mrs. McClellan Rhodes stood inside, her back to
the door. She was talking earnestly to a man whom
the Scouts instantly recognized as Ferd Baronni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get here?&rdquo; War muttered.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head, as he tried to catch a few
words of the conversation. Baronni was speaking
hurriedly and with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you left, I got nervous,&rdquo; he told the woman.
&ldquo;This man Livingston and his boys may make trouble
if they go on to the mine. It was a mistake to let
them come this far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think so myself,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhodes
replied. &ldquo;No good can result from their going on.
They must be discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you,&rdquo; the mining company agent
went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pulling out&mdash;going back to Cartagena
within the hour. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll handle everything,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhodes promised.
&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands and Baronni started toward the
door. Jack and War barely had time to duck back
behind the building before he emerged and walked
rapidly away.</p>
<p>Making no comment upon the alarming conversation
they had overheard, the Scouts waited five minutes.
Then, casually they sauntered into the banana
shed.</p>
<p>Seeing them, Mrs. Rhodes looked startled. &ldquo;Have
you been here long?&rdquo; she inquired with a show of
friendliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not long,&rdquo; Jack answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost our party and have been wandering
around through the rows,&rdquo; War added. &ldquo;Have you
seen Mr. Livingston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. Not since early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we see someone leave the shed a few
minutes ago?&rdquo; Jack inquired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes shot a quick look at him as if to read
any hidden meaning behind his words. The Scout&rsquo;s
expression of innocence reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one of the workmen,&rdquo; she replied indifferently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for the banana train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s deliberate lie made Jack and War
more than ever suspicious. Wisely, however, they
did not show their true feelings.</p>
<p>War picked up a discarded banana and began to
strip the peelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have one?&rdquo; he invited, offering another to Mrs.
Rhodes.</p>
<p>She drew back with a gesture of distaste. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
bear bananas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose one would get tired of them,&rdquo; commented
Jack politely. &ldquo;Still you find this plantation
interesting enough to visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shrugged. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;A friend of my husband&rsquo;s is a foreman here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Jack was quite certain that Mrs. Rhodes again was
lying. He believed that she had come to the plantation
either to keep the Scout party under surveillance
or to meet Ferd Baronni.</p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to believe, however, that the
latter had journeyed to Santa Marta on sudden
impulse, and had sought the woman after learning
that she was absent from her hotel. Their close association
deeply worried him. Why were the pair so
determined to prevent the Scout party from reaching
the Last Chance mine?</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, Mrs. Rhodes questioned
abruptly: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still planning on your trip
to the emerald mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our intention, unless we hear from Appleby
Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the trip most uncomfortable,&rdquo; Mrs.
Rhodes said, fanning herself with a green banana
leaf. &ldquo;There is no road. Only a trail. The temperature
extremes&mdash;intense heat in the valleys, and
freezing cold in the mountains, is most trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind hardships,&rdquo; Jack replied, amused
by the woman&rsquo;s attempt to discourage them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
used to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are,&rdquo; the woman returned. &ldquo;Well,
if I can&rsquo;t persuade you to give up the trip, let me
advise you to leave your valuables behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bandits?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One in particular. Carlos has been terrorizing
the mountainside, robbing the pack trains and making
travel most precarious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not afraid to make the journey, Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes returned Jack&rsquo;s steady gaze. &ldquo;No, I
have no fear,&rdquo; she responded briefly. &ldquo;I have lived
many years in Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What takes you to the mine?&rdquo; War asked rather
abruptly. &ldquo;Your husband isn&rsquo;t there any more, is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question plainly annoyed Mrs. Rhodes. She
dropped the banana leaf and moved quickly to the
shed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train is coming now,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;After
the bananas are loaded, we can ride to the main
gate. I should imagine that you will find the rest of
your party waiting there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and War made no further attempt to question
the woman. During the loading of the car, she
moved some distance away, coldly ignoring them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she&rsquo;d make more effort to try to convince
us we shouldn&rsquo;t go on to the mine,&rdquo; War remarked
as they watched the last of the loading. &ldquo;I
guess she realizes it&rsquo;s useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; Jack said grimly. &ldquo;Mrs.
Rhodes is a clever woman. She&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you figure she and that company agent
are so bent on keeping us away from the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; Jack returned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Something is stirring there, that&rsquo;s certain. Appleby
Corning said he was in trouble when he wrote Mr.
Livingston. It may be he&rsquo;s mixed up in some mess
the Rhodes&rsquo; have been cooking. I&rsquo;ll be relieved when
we manage to get in touch with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A toot of the engine informed the Scouts that the
banana car was about to move out. They swung
aboard and rode to the main gate. There, as Mrs.
Rhodes had predicted, Mr. Livingston and the other
Scouts anxiously awaited them.</p>
<p>Enroute back to the hotel, Jack and War related
the conversation they had overheard in the banana
shed. Mr. Livingston was gravely concerned, and
unable to understand why Ferd Baronni had trailed
the party to Santa Marta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distrusted that company agent at the start,&rdquo; he
admitted. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m more than ever convinced that
he&rsquo;s no friend of Appleby&rsquo;s. If only Mr. Corning
would get in touch with us, some of this fog might
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts reached the hotel and headed for the
dining room for a late lunch. As they crossed the
lobby, the clerk signalled Mr. Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wire for you,&rdquo; he said, thrusting an envelope
into the Scout leader&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Quickly, Mr. Livingston read the enclosed message.
His face became a puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Ken inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied, offering the
message for the others to read. &ldquo;This is from Appleby.
He says an unusual situation has developed at
the mine. We&rsquo;re instructed to return to Cartagena.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 11</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HITTING THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Return to Cartagena!&rdquo; Ken exclaimed after he
had reread the message delivered to Mr. Livingston.
&ldquo;Of all the miserable luck, this is the worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were headed for the emerald
mine,&rdquo; Willie added, sunk in gloom. &ldquo;Why did Corning
send for us anyway, if he doesn&rsquo;t want us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston was unable to explain the strange
communication. The failure of the mining engineer
to meet his party had worried him more than he had
confessed to the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, before we start packing, let me put in my
two cents worth,&rdquo; spoke up Jack. &ldquo;How did Corning
know we were at this hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Ken exclaimed, startled by the
implication of the other&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Maybe the
message is phony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent by Mrs. Rhodes or Ferd Baronni,&rdquo; suggested
Warwick. &ldquo;Jack and I know they&rsquo;re up to
something! They don&rsquo;t want us to go on to the
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, Mrs. Rhodes promised the company
agent she&rsquo;d take care of the matter,&rdquo; Jack went
on. &ldquo;Before we act hastily, shouldn&rsquo;t we try to check
on this message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it myself,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston offered. &ldquo;Wait
here for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For nearly two hours the Scout leader was absent
from the hotel. When finally he rejoined the Explorers,
his face was grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn anything?&rdquo; War eagerly greeted him as he
entered the bedroom where the Scouts awaited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. The message, supposedly from Appleby,
was delivered to the hotel by a boy, but it never
came from the telegraph communications office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Corning couldn&rsquo;t have sent it?&rdquo; questioned
Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly certain he didn&rsquo;t. The message must
be a fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea who sent it?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An idea, yes. But no proof. We couldn&rsquo;t trace the
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it, we&rsquo;ll not obey the instructions,&rdquo; Jack
remarked, well pleased by the investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m more than ever in favor of pushing on
to the mine above Emerald Valley. We can&rsquo;t get
there soon enough to please me. I have a feeling
Appleby didn&rsquo;t meet us because he&rsquo;s in bad trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can we get out of here?&rdquo; asked Ken
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can catch a plane to Bogota in an hour. I&rsquo;ve
already booked reservations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance Mr. Corning may show up here after
we leave?&rdquo; speculated Willie, quickly starting to
gather his scattered belongings.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston replied that the possibility seemed
a remote one. &ldquo;Except for the enjoyment we&rsquo;ve had
in seeing the banana plantations, I think it was a
mistake to come here,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe Ferd Baronni deliberately threw us
off the track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Willie. For some reason, he doesn&rsquo;t
want us to go on to the mine&mdash;possibly for fear of
what we may learn. This trip to Santa Marta, I suspect,
was only to keep us occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if we waited a month, you don&rsquo;t think Mr.
Corning ever would show up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my slant. I&rsquo;ve been unable to locate any
of those close friends Appleby was supposed to have
here. To be on the safe side, I&rsquo;ll leave a letter for
him here at the hotel. Now pack your duds, fellows.
We haven&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane flight to Bogota proved an uneventful
but thrilling experience for the Scouts. Accustomed
as they were to air travel, they were awed nevertheless,
by breath-taking views of the vast Magdalena
valley, forests of deep green, and the great ranges
of the Andes which divided the land into isolated
plateaus and valleys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>At the capital city, the party lingered half a day
before taking a bus to a little Colombian village high
in the cool hills. During their brief stay in Bogota,
Jack and Mr. Livingston twice visited the mining
company office. The official in charge, they learned,
had absented himself on a week&rsquo;s holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait for him,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston decided.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on to the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late the next morning, the bus deposited them in
the chilly little village which served as a take-off
point for the mine. The trail which the Scouts were
to follow wound sharply upward toward a line of
rugged mountain peaks and a narrow pass. Somewhere
beyond, lay the Last Chance mine.</p>
<p>Their lagging spirits revived by rolls and hot
spiced chocolate, the Scouts set about making arrangements
for mules to take them up the zigzag
trail to their destination.</p>
<p>From their Indian guide, Jose, Mr. Livingston
learned that Appleby Corning had not been seen in
the village for many weeks. His absence had occasioned
no alarm, for the engineer usually remained
secluded at the mine for months at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senora come here today,&rdquo; the guide reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senora?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston repeated in surprise.
&ldquo;What Senora, Jose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Senora that go on to mine. Wife of engineer
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning has no wife to my knowledge,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston replied. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the wife of
McClellan Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Senor.</i>&rdquo; The little guide pulled his <i>ruana</i> more
tightly about his shoulders as protection from the
chill wind. &ldquo;She leave on trail at dawn. Join husband
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information that Mrs. Rhodes had gone
ahead of them was most disconcerting to the Scouts.
Mr. Livingston was especially troubled to learn that
the deposed engineer might be at the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may explain though, why Appleby didn&rsquo;t
meet us,&rdquo; he told the Explorers. &ldquo;With McClellan
Rhodes on the scene, he might hesitate to leave,
even for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes sure must have traveled like a house
afire to get here ahead of us,&rdquo; Willie remarked
thoughtfully. Turning to Jose, he inquired: &ldquo;So
went on to the mine? Not alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Senor</i>, with a guide. Senora know trail well.
Travel light. Shoot straight like a man. Good
traveler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re mistaken about her going to the
mine to join her husband,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said,
frowning. &ldquo;Rhodes shouldn&rsquo;t be there. At least it
was my understanding that Corning sent him packing
when he took over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senora go to be with husband,&rdquo; the guide repeated.
&ldquo;At emerald mine changes come fast. Today
one engineer&mdash;tomorrow another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s information increased Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s
eagerness to be away. He urged that the
loading of the animals be hastened.</p>
<p>After numerous and vexing delays, the Scout
party finally set off single file into the hills. Considerable
equipment had to be taken, for the Explorers
repeatedly had been warned that they must
expect extremes of heat and cold, often within an
eight or ten mile stretch of trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd that a road never was built to the mine,&rdquo;
Willie remarked as he trudged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so odd,&rdquo; Jack returned. &ldquo;The government
never has been eager to make the mining area accessible.
Emeralds are too easily stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston backed him up.
&ldquo;About the only equipment needed for emerald mining
is a strong back, a pick axe and a crowbar.
Laborers are kept under contract and during the
period of their service, not permitted to leave the
area. That&rsquo;s to prevent theft of emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find an emerald while we&rsquo;re at the
mine,&rdquo; War remarked eagerly. &ldquo;A great big one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Jack teased
him. &ldquo;If you do find one, you won&rsquo;t be allowed to
walk off with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, the size of an emerald isn&rsquo;t as
important as its shape and color,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Before the Scouts had been long on the steep,
winding trail, they noted evidence that Mrs. Rhodes,
traveling fast, was well ahead of them. At a spring
they came upon her heel marks, and Willie picked
up a lacy handkerchief with the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo; embroidered
in one corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Rhodes, all right,&rdquo; he asserted gloomily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped Jose was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s making better time than we are,&rdquo; Jack
nodded in chagrin.</p>
<p>Skirting outthrusts of rock, the Scouts continued
to follow a fairly well outlined trail. As the sun
rose higher, they could see sharp peaks with caps of
snow outlined against the blue sky. Climbing above
the desolate little farms to a world of chilly isolation,
they met no one. Higher and higher they
struggled, marveling anew at the remarkable stamina
of the woman ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got to hand it to her,&rdquo; Willie admitted
grudgingly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste any sympathy or admiration,&rdquo; Jack
advised. &ldquo;That old gal has a grim purpose that is
driving her on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her as far as I could toss a
stick,&rdquo; Willie answered quickly. &ldquo;The mere fact that
she&rsquo;s going to the mine makes me suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true her husband is at Emerald Valley,
that&rsquo;ll make two of &rsquo;em to gang up on us,&rdquo; interposed
War soberly. &ldquo;I guess Appleby Corning will be glad
to see us arrive. He may be in a spot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Descending into a valley area where the trail was
nearly obliterated by dense foliage and creepers,
the Scouts encountered rain. It let up by late afternoon.
Nevertheless, Mr. Livingston decided to camp
early.</p>
<p>War and Willie soon had a fire going which enabled
them to dry out other wood for use during
the night. Damp clothing was hung on a quickly
constructed rack near the heat.</p>
<p>By the time supper was ready, everyone felt quite
comfortable. Jack and the guide looked after the
pack animals, while the other Scouts cleaned up the
camp for the night.</p>
<p>Returning to the fire, Jack stood for a moment
with his back to the flames. The night had closed
in dark and with a hint of more rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve had an uneasy feeling the last hour
or so,&rdquo; he confessed in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ken, busy laying out his eiderdown sleeping bag,
quickly raised his head. &ldquo;Uneasy?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;About going on to the mine, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack kept his voice low. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, Ken. I&rsquo;ve
had an odd feeling that someone has been trailing
us, even before we made camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expected Ken to laugh, but the other accepted
his remark seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the same feeling, Jack. The foliage is
so dense here that one gets that closed in sensation.
But who would follow us? Not Mrs. Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she couldn&rsquo;t have doubled back because
there&rsquo;s no other trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought several times in the last hour that
I&rsquo;ve heard a rustling among the foliage, Jack. Wild
animals probably. All the same, I think I&rsquo;ll look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already have, Ken. No sign of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just being jittery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Jack agreed, not completely convinced.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better keep a good fire going tonight, just
in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeding the dying flames with another cut log,
he started into the tent. Just then he was startled by
a slight rustling of leaves almost directly behind. He
and Ken both turned swiftly. Their pulses began to
pound.</p>
<p>Against the dark foliage, a man stood clearly outlined.
He was armed. As they stood frozen, he
spoke a sharp command in Spanish, and came slowly
toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 12</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CARLOS THE BANDIT</span></h2>
<p>Jack and Ken did not understand the words, but
the meaning was clear enough.</p>
<p>The smiling, hard-faced man who confronted
them was a bandit.</p>
<p>Before they could make any response to his command,
he fired a shot. The bullet nipped into the dirt
at Jack&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Thus warned that the grizzled little man was not
one with whom to trifle, the two Scouts quickly
raised their hands.</p>
<p>The shot had brought War, Willie and Jose out
of the shelter. They too were instantly covered and
forced to line up with their faces to a tree.</p>
<p>The bandit kept up a patter of Spanish which
only Jose could understand. Shaking with fear, he
interpreted for the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bandit is Carlos, who long has terrorized
the hills,&rdquo; he told them nervously. &ldquo;He says he will
not harm anyone, if his commands are obeyed. We
are to turn over all money and watches. If we refuse,
he shoot to kill!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Willie and War began to empty their pockets.
Jack and Ken were more deliberate. Their delay
brought an exclamation of impatience from the
bandit.</p>
<p>Carlos gazed sharply about the camp, evidently
aware that only five persons were accounted for.
What had become of Mr. Livingston, Jack wondered.
He remembered that the Scout leader had
slipped away from camp for a moment to bring in
more fire wood. Surely, he must have been alerted
by the firing of a shot!</p>
<p>Carlos swiftly scooped up the money and watches
which the Scouts reluctantly turned over. But before
he could stuff the loot into the pouch he carried
at his belt, there came a sharp command from
the darkness behind the bandit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s! The Scouts knew
that their leader was unarmed. Carlos, however,
had no such knowledge.</p>
<p>Startled, he whirled around and fired blindly into
the darkness.</p>
<p>In that instant, when the man&rsquo;s attention was
diverted from the captives by the fire, Jack and Ken
acted together.</p>
<p>Lunging forward, they tackled the bandit below
the knees. He went down, and in the brief but fierce
struggle, they succeeded in knocking the weapon
from his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>With the agility of a jungle cat, Carlos squirmed
from Jack&rsquo;s grasp. Slipping back into the foliage, he
was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
<p>Jack groped and finally found the lost weapon. He
started in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; ordered Mr. Livingston, who had
emerged into the circle of flickering firelight. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t possibly overtake him, and it&rsquo;s risky to try.
He&rsquo;ll have a horse tethered somewhere near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Scouts listened, they heard the bold bandit&rsquo;s
retreating footsteps. Then all became silent in
the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he comes back later, maybe with some
of his followers?&rdquo; War asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have his gun, so I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be back
tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied. &ldquo;Good work, Jack!
I thought you and Ken would react as you did! Any
of our stuff missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts took careful inventory. In his haste to
escape, the bandit had left behind all the cash and
jewelry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt Carlos will try another raid tonight,
knowing we&rsquo;ll be on the alert,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston commented.
&ldquo;All the same, we&rsquo;ll set up a guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident was more disturbing to Jose than to
the Scouts. For hours after the bandit had gone, he
huddled in his blanket, his back to a tree, fearfully
watching the shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>In broken English, he related to the Explorers
that Carlos was well known for his cruelty and bold
ways. Somewhere in the hills he maintained a hide-out
with a few faithful but disreputable followers.
The Colombian government had placed a price upon
his head. But no one ever had claimed the reward.
Year after year, the bandit continued to swoop
down on luckless travelers. Three times in the past
year he reportedly had made valuable hauls of
emeralds which were being taken out of the mine
for shipment.</p>
<p>Despite Jose&rsquo;s fears, no more was heard that night
from the bandit. The Scouts slept well, and as soon
as the sun came up, were on their way.</p>
<p>For several hours they pushed on, keeping an
alert watch for Carlos. At times, they imagined they
heard a soft rustling of the foliage along the trail,
but they saw no one. Jack had kept the bandit&rsquo;s
automatic as a souvenir, disregarding Jose&rsquo;s advice
to discard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep gun&mdash;Carlos come back for it,&rdquo; the
guide predicted grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; Jack returned cheerfully. &ldquo;Next time
I&rsquo;ll be more alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By noon, the party had reached a low ridge. As
they rested briefly, Jose pointed out a forested valley
and a fast-moving river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Chance mine,&rdquo; he informed the group. &ldquo;We
be there in next hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine is very old?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Senor.</i> It was worked before the Spanish
Conquest and many times lost. When the mine
close, workers move away&mdash;jungle close in. Mine
have many names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Last Chance sounds pretty modern,&rdquo; the
Scout leader remarked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Corning give it that name when he come,&rdquo;
Jose explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine why,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston remarked
to Jack. &ldquo;He figured that if he didn&rsquo;t make good
here, the mine might be closed again. At least the
company which employs him would lose its government
lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Carlos hovering around ready to swoop
down, I shouldn&rsquo;t think mining would be very
profitable,&rdquo; Ken contributed. &ldquo;That old boy is a pest!
Maybe Mr. Corning sent for us to help him get rid
of the hill bandits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; the Scout leader rejoined. &ldquo;Corning
would know how to deal with Carlos. No, I&rsquo;m afraid
the trouble is more serious than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to reach the mine, the party went on, working
through vines which had overgrown the trail.
After a wearisome struggle, they emerged onto a
wider path which showed evidence of recent use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Finally, they came out into a clearing which offered
a view of the mine. Spread before them at the
edge of a gorge were a cluster of wooden buildings
with thatched roofs. The largest, and most sturdily
constructed, they took to be the main office.</p>
<p>Weary and footsore, the arrivals left Jose in
charge of the animals, and tramped into the central
building. Their approach had been observed by
native workmen. Yet, there had been no one to
welcome them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning may be sick,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston remarked
anxiously.</p>
<p>He and the Scouts found themselves in an untidy
two-room office, furnished with a couch, a desk, a
safe and a filing cabinet. As they gazed about, a tall,
lean man with dark moustache came in through the
door they had just entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, gentlemen,&rdquo; he greeted them,
politely but without a flicker of a smile. &ldquo;Anything
I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for the engineer in charge,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleby Corning, I should have said,&rdquo; the Scout
leader corrected himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning no longer is in charge here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in charge?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston responded,
startled. &ldquo;There must be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mistake, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Corning ill?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the man replied somewhat indifferently.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here. The last time I saw him
was six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months!&rdquo; the Scout leader exclaimed. &ldquo;Impossible!
Why, I&rsquo;ve had letters from him and a
couple of cables since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I wouldn&rsquo;t know, Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Livingston,&rdquo; the Scout official supplied. &ldquo;Excuse
me for not introducing myself and the other members
of my party. Seeing you instead of my friend,
rather gave me a jolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; the other rejoined coldly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
McClellan Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned. &ldquo;You say
you&rsquo;re in charge here? The company reassigned
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer gazed at the Scout official with defiant,
unwavering eyes. &ldquo;I took charge when I found
everything going to the dogs here,&rdquo; he informed the
group. &ldquo;Someone had to do it, you understand. If I
had waited to get authority from the company, the
workers would have been gone, and the mine
stripped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Corning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you take over here?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
demanded. His voice was sharper than he meant it
to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corning wasn&rsquo;t here when you came?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was not. As I told you, I found everything in
a mess&mdash;workers preparing to pull out. I stepped in
to save the mine for the owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the engineer replied,
no longer hiding his impatience. &ldquo;I have important
work to do now, and can&rsquo;t answer any more questions.
Corning, I think, is dead. That&rsquo;s all I can tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 13</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE EMERALD PIT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, please,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston interposed
as the mining engineer started to leave the office.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long distance to see Appleby Corning.
I feel I must know more about his strange
disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes halted in the doorway, scowling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
busy,&rdquo; he replied pointedly. &ldquo;As I told you, work
isn&rsquo;t progressing as it should. Whenever I turn my
back, those confounded Indians lean on their tools,
instead of working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t keep you long,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned
in a quiet voice. &ldquo;Just tell us what became of
Mr. Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the engineer retorted in exasperation.
&ldquo;I thought I made that clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say he&rsquo;s probably dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a captive of Carlos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bandit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I assume. I&rsquo;d heard repeated reports that the
mine was being badly managed. I came here to see
if I could help. Lucky I did too. I found everything
in chaos. Bandits, led by Carlos, had dropped down
on the camp twelve hours earlier. They&rsquo;d robbed the
safe of emeralds and taken Corning captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What attempt have you made to trace Appleby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None?&rdquo; The Scout leader repeated sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless,&rdquo; the engineer informed him. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know this country. Carlos is a devil. It would
take a small army to blast him out of his hide-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem such a bold demon when we
brushed into him,&rdquo; Jack drawled, entering the conversation.
&ldquo;In fact, he turned tail and ran like a
coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes turned to stare intently at the youth. &ldquo;You
encountered Carlos?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the trail. He was alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to rob us,&rdquo; contributed Ken, &ldquo;but we
were fortunate enough to elude him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos doesn&rsquo;t usually operate alone,&rdquo; Rhodes
informed the group. &ldquo;You were lucky he didn&rsquo;t shoot
you at sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d known that he had taken Mr. Corning
captive, we&rsquo;d have pursued him,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said. &ldquo;Where is his hide-out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has half a dozen of them back in the
hills,&rdquo; the mining engineer returned vaguely. &ldquo;He
moves from one to another. A reward has been
placed on his head, but no one ever collects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You say you&rsquo;ve made no effort to try to find
Corning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Rhodes retorted, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like
your tone, Mister. You know what these mountain
trails are like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t send natives to look for him. They
wouldn&rsquo;t venture a step. As for myself, it would be
folly to leave the mine. My first duty is to the
operators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So nothing is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put it that way,&rdquo; Mr. Rhodes returned,
his eyes flashing. &ldquo;If your friend is still alive&mdash;which
I seriously doubt&mdash;there will be a ransom demand
in time. It will be prohibitive, of course. Whether
or not it is met, will be up to the mine operators,
not to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied to sit and wait, Mr. Rhodes.
Appleby and I were close friends. Something must
be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do it!&rdquo; the engineer snapped. He
started to leave the office, then paused again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
put you up here for a day or so, if you&rsquo;re not too
particular about your accommodations,&rdquo; he told the
group. &ldquo;One of the men will show you to your quarters
as soon as the place has been fumigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fumigated?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s eyebrows jerked
upward. &ldquo;For insects, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. The last occupant died of some unknown
disease that&rsquo;s been knocking the natives off
like flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, we&rsquo;ll use our sleeping bags and
remain out-of-doors,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston stated. &ldquo;We
have our canvas shelters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; the engineer shrugged. &ldquo;The
nights here get pretty cold though. After a couple
of days, I think you&rsquo;ll be hitting the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one made a reply. The engineer hesitated a
moment, and then without saying more, went out
of the building. The Scouts saw him descend a
series of roughly hewn stone steps into a pit where a
dozen natives were at work.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston made certain that no one loitered
near the office, before he spoke. Then he said: &ldquo;The
situation is a lot worse than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes may be lying!&rdquo; Ken asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Appleby Corning really is dead?&rdquo;
War asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened to him, that&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo;
the Scout leader replied. &ldquo;I was afraid of it when he
didn&rsquo;t meet us or send word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, there&rsquo;s something fishy about
Rhodes&rsquo; story,&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;Why would he show
up here at exactly the right moment to check on the
mine? Wasn&rsquo;t he discharged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my understanding, Jack. Corning
didn&rsquo;t write very much, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;The natural thing after being discharged would
be to clear out,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;Rhodes apparently
didn&rsquo;t do that. He hung around, waiting for a chance
to move in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe he created that chance!&rdquo; suggested
Willie. &ldquo;Maybe he did away with Corning himself!
I&rsquo;ll bet the tale about Carlos swooping down here
is a phony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston conceded. &ldquo;That
part should be easy to check, if we can talk with
the natives. Some of them must speak a little English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes has moved in here to further his own
interests, and he doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what became
of Appleby Corning,&rdquo; Willie expanded his theory.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to his advantage not to have him found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Jack. &ldquo;Getting rid of Corning
may have been part of a well-planned scheme. If
it&rsquo;s true that Rhodes came here only ten days ago,
it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;d have had time to get word to his
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet she knew he was in charge here days ago!&rdquo;
Ken exclaimed. &ldquo;Otherwise, she wouldn&rsquo;t have made
the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly afraid Appleby has been the victim
of treachery,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to learn what became of him, and not depend on
Rhodes&rsquo; word either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might drive him into a corner, and try to
force the truth out of him,&rdquo; War proposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The others vetoed his suggestion. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t
get us anywhere,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston objected. &ldquo;Rhodes
controls the natives here. His word is law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we organize search parties?&rdquo; Willie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this jungle growth?&rdquo; Jack caught him up. &ldquo;It
would be worse than looking for a needle in a haystack!
Without a clue as to Carlos&rsquo; hide-out, we&rsquo;d
lose ourselves, and never find Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it looks to me,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
admitted. &ldquo;Another thing, I&rsquo;m not fully convinced
that my friend was seized by bandits. Our first job
is to confirm that fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes won&rsquo;t do anything to help us,&rdquo; Ken said.
&ldquo;Where do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you fellows get settled, I&rsquo;ll amble around
to see what I can learn,&rdquo; Jack offered.</p>
<p>Once outside the office building, curiosity led him
toward the V-shaped pit where stocky Indians labored
with crowbar and pick. A vein of beryl lay
exposed.</p>
<p>With infinite skill, the laborers shattered the rock,
taking care not to smash the calcite or the emeralds.
Eagerly, Rhodes examined the exposed gems. But
the take did not satisfy him. With an exclamation of
rage, he struck one of the workers in the face.</p>
<p>The fellow stumbled backward against the rocks.
A small object rolled from his gnarled hand. Only
then did Jack realize that Rhodes&rsquo; anger had been
caused by the native&rsquo;s thievery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The engineer seized the gem and dropped it into
his leather pouch. His gaze fell upon Jack who stood
watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; he ordered harshly. &ldquo;No one is
allowed near the vein except the workmen! Believe
me, I have enough trouble watching them. They
steal me blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You or the company?&rdquo; Jack asked, irked by the
engineer&rsquo;s unwarranted attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The company,&rdquo; Rhodes corrected himself.
&ldquo;Every gem taken from this mine is accounted for,
I assure you. But the vein&rsquo;s playing out. A new pit
must be opened, or the mine soon will close down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no reply for his eyes were on the fallen
workman. The fellow had no shoes, his trousers were
ragged, and his shirt torn. It was his gaze however,
that held the Scout&rsquo;s attention. The man was eyeing
Rhodes with a deep, smoldering hatred.</p>
<p>The engineer himself became aware of the expression.
Ignoring Jack for the moment, he strode
over and bestowed a savage kick upon the fallen
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieving leech!&rdquo; he berated him. &ldquo;Stupid, stealing
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wrath expended, the engineer again turned
upon Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I ask you to get out of here?&rdquo; he asked
coldly but with his voice now carefully controlled.
&ldquo;No one is allowed in the pit. It&rsquo;s a company rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jack apologized. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave. You
needn&rsquo;t worry, though, about any of the Scouts
taking your emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; The engineer flashed an amused smile.
&ldquo;Son, if you&rsquo;re here long enough, you may find their
lure irresistible. Many a murder has been committed
for an emerald&mdash;here at this mine too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleby Corning being the latest victim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos has preyed upon this mine for years,&rdquo;
Rhodes replied, not answering Jack&rsquo;s question directly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad actor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t someone clean out his gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the United States,&rdquo; Rhodes retorted.
&ldquo;The authorities can&rsquo;t be bothered. Now will you
move out and stop asking so many questions? You
hinder me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded and climbed out of the pit, but not
before he had made careful note of the fallen workman.
He would remember the face. Later, if he
approached the matter right, the man might talk.</p>
<p>Leaving the pit, he sought his companions, who
had pitched their tents in a sheltered area some
distance from the huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn anything, Jack?&rdquo; Ken accosted him as he
came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Rhodes drove me out of the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;We took a look at that hut Rhodes assigned to
us,&rdquo; Willie informed him in disgust. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst
looking hole in the place. We figure he wanted to
make it as tough as possible for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mrs. Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s moved into the best place in the diggings,
with her husband.&rdquo; Ken pointed to a well-built
frame structure near the main office. &ldquo;That must
have been where Appleby Corning lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could look through his papers,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said. &ldquo;We might run into something that
would help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of clue?&rdquo; Jack questioned, staring
thoughtfully toward the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually know, Jack. But there&rsquo;s more to
this raid and kidnapping than Rhodes has told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get in and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now at any rate,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston rejected
his proposal. &ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes is in there. We saw her
go in a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows we&rsquo;re here, but she just ignores us,&rdquo;
added War. &ldquo;Suits me fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Jose, War and Willie to unpack the
equipment, the other three started toward the office.
Enroute, Jack told of the beating Rhodes had
inflicted upon the peon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston commented.
&ldquo;Rhodes is a brute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man was trying to steal an emerald,&rdquo; Jack
admitted. &ldquo;Obviously, he hates Rhodes and probably
would like to get even. I&rsquo;ll talk to him at the
first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not get anything,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston advised.
&ldquo;Jose might have better luck. At least, he
could draw the fellow out better, and Rhodes
wouldn&rsquo;t be suspicious if he saw them together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of Jose!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the ticket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three had reached the little office on the rise
of land. An outer door stood open to the breeze.
Jack was surprised to see that Rhodes had left the
pit and now was inside the building.</p>
<p>His back was to the approaching trio. He had
squatted before the big safe, and deftly was turning
the dials.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, the three halted, alerted by the
engineer&rsquo;s tense attitude. Why, they wondered, did
he act so furtively, as if engaged in a dishonest act?</p>
<p>The big safe door swung open. Rhodes reached in
and drew out a long, cardboard box. Dipping in his
hand, he lifted out a fistful of green emeralds.</p>
<p>Gloatingly, as a miser would gaze at his hoard of
gold, he fondled the gems. The watchers saw him
compare some of the larger emeralds with those
taken from his leather pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something fishy about this!&rdquo; Jack muttered.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he tell us that ten days ago, Carlos
broke into the safe and took all the emeralds? Why,
that handful must represent weeks of digging!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>His voice, though scarcely above a whisper, had
carried inside the building.</p>
<p>Startled, Rhodes suddenly straightened. Seeing
the three just outside the door, he thrust all the gems
back into the box and hurriedly locked the safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 14</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BRIBE OFFER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I was just putting away the emeralds that were
brought up this morning,&rdquo; McClellan Rhodes remarked
as Mr. Livingston and the two Scouts
tramped into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a haul?&rdquo; inquired the Scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair.&rdquo; Reluctant to discuss the subject of emeralds,
the mining engineer dismissed the matter.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pitched your tent, I see,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Well, you can take your meals with my wife and
me for today. I&rsquo;d advise an early start in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t planned on leaving,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Rhodes voice was sharp. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to
seem inhospitable, but visitors aren&rsquo;t particularly
welcome here at the mine. No facilities, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind roughing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; Rhodes said shortly. &ldquo;Your presence
here would interfere with the work. If it&rsquo;s
worry about Corning that is holding you, let me say
again, there is absolutely nothing you can do. In
time, there may be a ransom demand&mdash;probably in
emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you tell us earlier today that Carlos
stripped the safe?&rdquo; Jack interposed.</p>
<p>There was a moment of strained silence, and the
engineer&rsquo;s dark eyes glinted with suppressed anger.
But his voice was carefully controlled when he
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Since then, we&rsquo;ve dug a few more.
I just finished washing them in a bath of hydrochloric
acid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack let the remark go unchallenged. He was convinced
however, that the man was lying. Since he
had left him in the pit, there had been insufficient
time to clean the day&rsquo;s gleaning of emeralds. Yet
the cardboard box, replaced in the safe, had contained
at least a double handful of fine specimens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me everything you know about the
bandit raid,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston urged, seating himself
on a high stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to tell. When I arrived here, the workers
were preparing to pull out. They told me Carlos
and his men had swooped down the night before,
terrorizing the camp. Your friend Corning was
caught by surprise and taken prisoner. The bandits
made him open the safe. They took the emeralds
and a little cash and rode off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd they&rsquo;d burden themselves with Corning,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston commented. &ldquo;Especially after they
got what they wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos doesn&rsquo;t miss any bets. He&rsquo;ll make a ransom
demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier today you said you were convinced Corning
is dead,&rdquo; Ken reminded him. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re pretty
sure he&rsquo;s being held prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do? Mix me up?&rdquo; Rhodes
shot at him. &ldquo;I told you I think your friend is dead,
and I&rsquo;ll stick by it. But if he&rsquo;s still alive, there will
be a ransom demand. Do I make myself clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Ken drawled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be
inquisitive, but to help us get the picture, would you
mind telling us why the mine operators hired Corning
in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to, because it was a mistake, and they
realize it now. Until Corning took over, I&rsquo;d been in
charge here for nearly three years. Emerald production
began to drop during the last six months or so.
That wasn&rsquo;t my fault. The vein&rsquo;s played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was because production had fallen off
that Corning was assigned here?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was behind it,&rdquo; Rhodes admitted with a
scowl. &ldquo;Corning&rsquo;s a big talker. He sold himself and
ran me down&mdash;convinced the operators that the
miners weren&rsquo;t being handled right, and that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; the Scout leader prompted as Rhodes
ended in mid-sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the engineer said shortly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
there was to it. Corning took over here and things
went to the dogs fast. He had a wild theory that he
could find the old mine that was worked at the time
of the Spanish Conquest. He spent a lot of his time
searching for it, and even had some of the natives
helping him. Production fell off more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning didn&rsquo;t find the rich vein?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
questioned to keep the other talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think? That old mine has been lost
for centuries, and it will stay hidden for years to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning always was a methodical sort of fellow,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston said thoughtfully. &ldquo;If he searched for
that old vein, he must have done it systematically.
He&rsquo;d have left a record of his work too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did make a map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A map?&rdquo; Jack interposed eagerly. &ldquo;May we see
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, may we see it?&rdquo; Jack insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the safe, and I haven&rsquo;t time to get it out
now,&rdquo; Mr. Rhodes said, looking at his wrist watch.
&ldquo;I must get back to the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making certain that the safe door was locked, the
engineer abruptly quitted the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That talk about the map certainly made him pull
out in a hurry,&rdquo; Ken remarked when they were
alone. &ldquo;What do you think, Hap?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;That he was lying again,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston answered.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he has the slightest concern
about Appleby Corning&rsquo;s welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was it that he just happened to arrive
here at the opportune time to take over the mine for
the owners?&rdquo; Jack added. &ldquo;Fishy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken had moved to the desk, an old fashioned roll
top affair. It was locked. On top of a bookcase devoted
to mining journals and books on mineralogy
were numerous specimens of rock, an Indian bow
and arrow and other trinkets.</p>
<p>Noticing several sheets of paper thrust into one
of the books, he examined them. All were blank,
evidently having been used as a page marker.</p>
<p>Inspired by Ken&rsquo;s activity, Jack also searched the
room for possible clues, even peering behind the
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Corning left any papers behind, they&rsquo;re locked
in the desk,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Rhodes wouldn&rsquo;t be
dumb enough to leave anything kicking around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might at the house where Corning lived,&rdquo;
Ken suggested. &ldquo;Naturally, he wouldn&rsquo;t figure we&rsquo;d
do any searching there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we?&rdquo; Jack demanded. &ldquo;Not with Mrs.
Rhodes camped on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t stay there forever. Maybe, if we watch
our chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston demurred. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
risky thing to do and not to my liking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dealing with honorable people,&rdquo; Jack
reminded him. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we try to learn the truth
about what happened here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston reluctantly consented.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see, though, that we&rsquo;re likely to come
upon anything that will help us trace Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go for the authorities,&rdquo; Ken proposed.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they organize a search party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, Ken. But from what I&rsquo;ve been told, the
authorities don&rsquo;t concern themselves very much with
the activities of Carlos. He&rsquo;s a law unto himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about setting off by ourselves?&rdquo; Ken asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Rhodes told us the truth when he said
the country hereabouts is impossible. Once we left
the trail, we&rsquo;d have to hack our way foot by foot.
We&rsquo;d have no chance of reaching Carlos&rsquo; hide-out
without a guide. And who knows the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; Ken added, &ldquo;if we did succeed in
finding it, we&rsquo;d be no match for Carlos and his
armed followers. They&rsquo;d make short work of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; Jack asked in discouragement.
&ldquo;Give up? Return to Bogota or Cartagena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it over, and I intend to stay here at
the mine for a day or two at least,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not convinced that Corning is dead.
If there should be a ransom demand, I want to be
on hand when it comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Rhodes let us stay, do you think?&rdquo; Jack
questioned doubtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may become quite unpleasant,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
admitted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ignore his hints to leave, and
see what happens. Circulate a bit, meanwhile, and
see what information you can pick up. I&rsquo;ll do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quitting the little office, the three went out into
the bright sunlight. Jack noted that Mrs. Rhodes
was seated in the screened porch of Corning&rsquo;s former
dwelling. Although she appeared to be reading
a magazine, he noticed that her gaze followed the
trio.</p>
<p>Workmen were coming up out of the mine pit, to
eat their lunch. The man whom McClellan Rhodes
had abused, sat down with his back to a rock and
began munching a cold tortilla. Jack sauntered over
to speak to him.</p>
<p>Before he had spoken more than a phrase of halting
Spanish, he heard heavy steps behind him.
Turning, he saw Rhodes bearing down upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to talk to the workmen,&rdquo; he told Jack
harshly. &ldquo;A company rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you have a lot of &rsquo;em around here,&rdquo;
Jack growled. &ldquo;I was only passing the time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference. You know my orders.
Stay out of the pit, and away from the miners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jack agreed, deciding to make no issue
of the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>He ambled down to the edge of a deep but swift
flowing stream some distance from the camp but
within the cleared area. A log bridge, made by felling
a tall tree, spanned the torrent. He started to
cross, but had taken scarcely three steps on the
precarious footing when Rhodes again descended
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; the engineer shouted.</p>
<p>Startled, Jack nearly lost his balance. Retreating
to shore, he waited for Rhodes to come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay in camp!&rdquo; the engineer ordered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go
wandering around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely intended to cross the stream,&rdquo; Jack
replied, nettled. &ldquo;I hope I have better sense than to
go roaming the wilds without leaving a trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is allowed across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the bridge? Decoration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes coldly ignored the question. &ldquo;My wife
has lunch ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an excellent cook
and I trust you&rsquo;ll enjoy her cooking during your
brief stay here. You will join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Jack responded, feeling at a disadvantage.
&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to put you to any trouble,
or your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble,&rdquo; the engineer said shortly. &ldquo;Come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack fell into step. As they left the river, Rhodes
relaxed somewhat and talked cheerfully of a recent
visit he had made to the coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me, do you?&rdquo; he abruptly asked
the Scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The unexpected question caught Jack off guard.
At a loss for a reply, he began to stammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me all wrong,&rdquo; the engineer went on.
&ldquo;Maybe I seem abrupt, but this is rough country,
and one can&rsquo;t be too careful. Worried about Corning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, if anything can be done, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo;
Rhodes assured him. &ldquo;The point I&rsquo;m trying to make
is this, you can&rsquo;t help him by remaining here. You&rsquo;ll
only hinder my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Mr. Livingston to decide what we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I gathered.&rdquo; The engineer eyed Jack shrewdly.
&ldquo;But your opinion carries weight with him. I saw
that right away. Now if you and the other boys were
to talk to him, you could make him see how foolish
it is to remain here. I&rsquo;ll make it worth your while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes drew a small emerald from his pocket. In
the sunlight it shown with a deep fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice the color,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;A perfect gem.
You like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel it&mdash;roll it in your hand,&rdquo; Rhodes urged,
closing Jack&rsquo;s fingers over the gem. &ldquo;Now all you
need to do is convince Mr. Livingston to leave here
by tomorrow morning. Do that and this emerald is
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 15</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MAP OF A MINE</span></h2>
<p>Annoyed by the attempted bribe, Jack returned
the emerald to the mining engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sorry, you can&rsquo;t buy me.
Seems you&rsquo;re mighty eager to get us away from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing.&rdquo; Rhodes replaced the gem in a
pouch which Jack noticed contained even larger
emeralds. &ldquo;Visitors interfere with the work. I was
willing to make it worth your while to leave&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt Mr. Livingston will pull out while his
friend is held captive by bandits. Odd isn&rsquo;t it, that
there&rsquo;s been no ransom demand in so many days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing odd about it,&rdquo; Rhodes retorted. &ldquo;Corning&rsquo;s
probably dead. Carlos is without heart, cruel
and vicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not organize a party and track him down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d elude us. No, the only thing to do is to be
patient and see what develops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Jack made no reply, although Rhodes&rsquo; views displeased
him. He had tried to hide his anger at being
offered a bribe. Nevertheless, he was more than
ever convinced that Rhodes wanted to get the
Scouts away from the mine to prevent them from
learning important facts about Corning&rsquo;s kidnapping.</p>
<p>Thinking it over, he decided to make his own
investigation by talking to some of the miners. No
opportunity presented itself, however. Whenever he
approached a workman, Rhodes quickly arrived
upon the scene.</p>
<p>Biding his time, Jack waited until nightfall. Then,
slipping away from the Scout tent, he stole to the
thatched roof shack of Phillipe, the man Rhodes had
struck.</p>
<p>A soft tap on the door brought the miner to the
door. Suspiciously, he gazed at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>&mdash;friend,&rdquo; Jack assured him. In halting
Spanish he asked to be admitted.</p>
<p>The man allowed him to enter the barren hovel.
Laboriously, Jack tried to make him understand that
he sought information about Mr. Corning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bandits come, <i>Senor</i>,&rdquo; the miner informed him
with gestures. &ldquo;They ride off with <i>Senor</i> Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the emeralds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Senor</i>. Carlos get nothing. <i>Senor</i> Corning refuse
to open safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Jack remarked, half to himself.
&ldquo;Rhodes told us Carlos cleaned out the safe. He
must have lied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senor</i> Rhodes lie about many things,&rdquo; Phillipe
muttered. &ldquo;Old mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words froze on his lips. Unnoticed, Rhodes
had approached and now stood, feet astride, in the
open doorway.</p>
<p>Coldly, he addressed Jack. &ldquo;I figured I&rsquo;d find you
here. Trying to stir trouble among my workers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; Jack denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your quarters and remain there for the
night! Must I remind you, this is an emerald mining
camp and that regulations must be rigid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack held his tongue, knowing that opposition
most certainly would result in a beating for Phillipe.
He left with the engineer, separating from him at
the cottage. Going on to the Scout camp, he was
surprised to find his friends in earnest conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack,&rdquo; War greeted him. &ldquo;Did you take that
gun&mdash;the one we snatched from Carlos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t touched it,&rdquo; Jack rejoined. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
it under my sleeping bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s swiped it,&rdquo; War informed him.
&ldquo;Rhodes probably! We saw him poking his nose into
the tent before supper. I&rsquo;ll bet he took it to make
sure we don&rsquo;t start anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s demand it back!&rdquo; Willie urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston advised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d only
deny he took it. Besides, maybe we&rsquo;re better off
without that weapon. Loaded guns do cause accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Dismissing the matter of the lost revolver, Jack
told the group of his talk with Phillipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning was kidnapped, all right,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;But why did Rhodes lie about the emeralds? Apparently,
Carlos didn&rsquo;t steal them, because Corning
wouldn&rsquo;t open the safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That needn&rsquo;t have stopped him,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
pointed out. &ldquo;He could have blown it quite easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemingly, emeralds weren&rsquo;t Carlos&rsquo; main objective.
He must have swooped down here with the
deliberate intention of taking Corning captive. For
ransom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made no demand as yet,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
commented. &ldquo;Furthermore, those emeralds in the
safe would be worth far more than he could expect
to get in a cash demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole deal looks phony,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Rhodes
knows more than he&rsquo;s telling, and he&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll
find out something by talking to the miners. That&rsquo;s
why he watches me so closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to look over Corning&rsquo;s papers,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said thoughtfully. &ldquo;If ever he searched
for an old mine, I&rsquo;m sure he would have left a record
of his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could ask Rhodes to let us look over his
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, this afternoon, Jack. He denied me access
to the office file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not look without his permission?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to do that, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dealing with a guy who has no scruples,&rdquo;
Jack pointed out. &ldquo;Anyway, let&rsquo;s breeze him again.
Maybe if we bear down hard, he&rsquo;ll let us go through
Corning&rsquo;s papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston agreed.</p>
<p>Leaving the other Scouts behind, the pair walked
to the office. The building was lighted with two
gasoline lamps, but upon entering, they found no
one there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes is at the house, I guess,&rdquo; the Scout leader
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this may be our chance,&rdquo; Jack suggested.
His gaze fastened upon the filing cabinet. &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Jack agreed. He tried the wooden
drawer, and to his surprise, it pulled open.</p>
<p>Stuffed into the back of the file were samples of
rock and a bottle of chemical. Manila folders were
stacked in the front, each neatly labeled. However,
nearly all were empty of papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes must have cleaned out about everything,&rdquo;
Jack commented. &ldquo;Nothing here apparently,
except routine letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out a second drawer, entirely empty
except for a long roll of heavy paper, tied with cord.
Impelled by curiosity, he untied the knot and spread
out the sheet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a map!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;A map of an
emerald mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston demanded. Getting
up, he went to the desk to peer over Jack&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The map was roughly drawn, but to scale. Even
a casual glance convinced the two that it was not a
representation of the Last Chance mining operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be located across the stream,&rdquo; Jack
said, his interest growing. &ldquo;In the densely forested
area. You don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it might be a drawing of the old lost Spanish
mine?&rdquo; supplied Mr. Livingston. &ldquo;It could be,
Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine seems to be situated south of here,&rdquo;
Jack went on, studying the markings intently. &ldquo;Some
of these lines have been erased and re-drawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map can&rsquo;t have too much value, or it
wouldn&rsquo;t have been left out of the safe,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
replied. &ldquo;The legend appears to be in Corning&rsquo;s
handwriting, but I&rsquo;m sure some of the writing isn&rsquo;t
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two poured over the drawings, they were
startled to hear approaching footsteps. Quickly, Jack
thrust the map back into the filing cabinet drawer.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he closed it than the door was flung
open. But it was not McClellan Rhodes who stood
there, but Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick!&rdquo; he urged the pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked alertly.
&ldquo;Anyone hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie shook his head. &ldquo;War and I were taking a
little walk down the trail before turning in for the
night. We saw something mighty queer! We want
you both to see it too! Come right away or it may be
too late!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 16</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SIGNALS</span></h2>
<p>Taking time only to replace the map in the filing
cabinet, Jack and Mr. Livingston followed War and
Willie outside the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Willie promised, leading the way
down the trail.</p>
<p>The night was dark, with only a sliver of a moon
to light the path. Though the Scouts had flashlights,
they avoided using them.</p>
<p>The mountain mist swirled about them as they
crept through a tunnel of trees to an outcropping of
rock which gave an unobstructed view. Below, but
invisible, lay the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you fellows bring us here?&rdquo; Jack demanded,
as Willie and War paused. &ldquo;What is there
to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; War advised.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, Mr. Livingston and Jack were
startled to catch the flash of a light. It appeared to
come from another rock almost level with them,
jutting out from the mountain side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The beam went on and off in a series of flashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code!&rdquo; Jack muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s code, all right,&rdquo; Willie agreed, &ldquo;but not
Morse. Nothing you can read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the four watched, there was an answering
series of flashes from below. The light signals seemed
to come from a level of perhaps a third of the distance
to the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Jack demanded. &ldquo;Who is
signaling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes at this end,&rdquo; War informed him. &ldquo;Willie
and I learned that much before we came to the
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no houses down there&mdash;nothing but
trail,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said. &ldquo;Can it be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s signaling Carlos, the bandit?&rdquo; War
supplied eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way Willie and I
doped it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of that possibility,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
admitted. &ldquo;Rhodes isn&rsquo;t bothered by Corning&rsquo;s
disappearance. I&rsquo;m sure of that. He may have
plotted it, though I hate to think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d do anything to stay at the mine as engineer,&rdquo;
Willie said grimly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t making the
slightest effort to trace Mr. Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that way to me,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded.
&ldquo;Of course, unless the authorities will undertake
a search, there&rsquo;s not much that can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes must know the hide-out of those bandits,&rdquo;
Jack asserted. &ldquo;Shall we breeze him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s not let him know that we saw him
signaling,&rdquo; the Scout leader decided after a slight
hesitation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d tell us nothing. We&rsquo;ll learn far
more by appearing dumb, and keeping an alert
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the signaling had ceased, the Scouts waited
until Rhodes had returned to his cottage. Then rejoining
Ken at their own camp, they discussed the
strange flashes.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the Scouts agreed with Mr. Livingston
that it would be folly to set off into wild country
in search of a bandit camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With more definite information, we may be able
to get the authorities to step in,&rdquo; the Scout leader
suggested. &ldquo;I propose that we disregard Rhodes&rsquo;
order to leave, and stay here a few days longer to
see what we can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Rhodes was signaling Carlos, it&rsquo;s a cinch he
plotted Mr. Corning&rsquo;s kidnapping,&rdquo; Jack speculated.
&ldquo;But how can we prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When no one answered, he abruptly arose from
the fire. &ldquo;Phillipe may be our answer,&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try once more to talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling on a heavy jacket, he swung down a dark
path toward the miner&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>He had walked only a short distance when a figure
suddenly emerged from the shadows. Rhodes
stood there, blocking the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out rather late, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the engineer asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just taking a walk,&rdquo; Jack muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better walk back to your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack hesitated, ready to give argument. But he
recalled Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s advice that it would be
wise to make a show of cooperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he agreed, turning around. &ldquo;This mountain
air is too chilly for comfort anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unsafe to go wandering around after dark,&rdquo;
Rhodes continued, walking with Jack. &ldquo;Someone
might misjudge your motives and take a shot at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go about though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; the engineer answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
armed and the miners know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked with Jack to the camp, and there left
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless,&rdquo; Jack reported his failure to the other
Scouts. &ldquo;Rhodes will have this camp watched all
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well turn in,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston advised.
&ldquo;Something may develop tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts spent a comfortable night in their
sleeping bags. As they were cleaning up the next
morning, Rhodes strode down the path. His quick
glance noted that no preparation had been made
for departure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be pulling out soon?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t figured on it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you yesterday that you can&rsquo;t remain here.
Company rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving until we learn if my friend is
still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do him any good by staying here,&rdquo;
Rhodes said, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;Return to Bogota.
If there is a ransom demand, I&rsquo;ll notify you at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan to stay another day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it impossible? What reason do you have
for wanting us to leave at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no reason,&rdquo; the engineer replied. &ldquo;I told
you it&rsquo;s a company rule. You refuse to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you driven out!&rdquo; Rhodes exclaimed, losing
his temper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you who is in charge here.
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tirade was interrupted by the arrival of
Phillipe. The miner&rsquo;s grimy face was pale beneath
his broad, floppy hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick, <i>Senor</i>!&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble in the pit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Senor</i>, the men refuse to dig. They say it is
not safe&mdash;danger of a slide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rot! There&rsquo;s no danger!&rdquo; Rhodes fumed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Temporarily forgetting his feud with the Scouts,
he went quickly with Phillipe. Curious to learn what
was happening, Mr. Livingston and the Explorers
followed.</p>
<p>Miners had clustered at the top of the pit, chattering
excitedly in their own tongue. As Rhodes came
up, they showed him a crack which had developed
in the rock wall above the big hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Rhodes assured them. &ldquo;Back to
your digging!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miners sullenly refused to budge. Rhodes
whipped out a revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no danger!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Get back to
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwillingly, the miners picked up their tools and
slowly descended into the pit. Rhodes remained
above, his revolver held in readiness.</p>
<p>Mechanically, the miners worked, now and then
raising their eyes fearfully to the towering rock
above them. As their crowbars failed to dislodge
even powdery dust from above, they relaxed somewhat.</p>
<p>Presently a pocket of emeralds was uncovered. In
great excitement, Rhodes rushed down to examine
the gems. All were small and of poor color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This vein is playing out!&rdquo; he exclaimed wrathfully.</p>
<p>Pocketing the gems, he started to climb the rough
rock steps. Watching from above, the Scouts saw
him halt to re-examine the emeralds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes seems determined to get everything he
can from this pit without loss of time,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
remarked in a low tone.</p>
<p>Jack nodded. He had raised his eyes to the wall
of rock above the engineer. Suddenly he was struck
with horror! A new crack, much deeper than the
other, had formed.</p>
<p>Even as he gazed in sick fascination, it widened
and moved horizontally, like a runner in a silk
stocking.</p>
<p>Jarred to a realization of the danger, he shouted
a hoarse warning to the engineer below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slide! Run for your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes heard, but he seemed rooted to where he
stood. As he jerked his eyes up to stare at the towering
wall, the rock began to move.</p>
<p>With a choked, terrified cry, the engineer leaped
wildly up the steps. For a moment, it appeared that
he might make it safely.</p>
<p>The great main mass of rock and dirt fell behind
him, sending up a cloud of dust. But Rhodes was
caught by the edge of the slide. A huge rock felled
him.</p>
<p>Clawing and fighting, he was buried beneath the
debris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 17</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN EARTH SLIDE</span></h2>
<p>Even before the dust from the slide had cleared
away, Mr. Livingston and the Scouts were frantically
at work. Descending into the pit, they organized
the miners and themselves seized shovels.</p>
<p>Rhodes&rsquo; left arm and his cap lay exposed. In a
matter of minutes, they had freed him from the
tomb of earth and rock.</p>
<p>Badly battered and unconscious, the engineer
nevertheless still breathed.</p>
<p>On an improvised stretcher, Rhodes was carried
to the cottage. His wife, meeting the procession,
gazed at the prone figure, and uttered an agonized
shriek. Becoming calm after a moment, she bade the
Scouts carry her husband into the bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How badly is he hurt?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston told her.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lucky though, to be alive. How far is the nearest
doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bogota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to do what we can for him ourselves.
Get hot water and bandages. Antiseptic. Pain
drugs if you have them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes hastened to obey the orders. Though
the Scouts never had admired the woman, they now
found themselves feeling very sorry for her. In the
emergency, she worked efficiently and did not allow
herself to become emotional.</p>
<p>Getting the engineer undressed and into bed, the
Explorers examined him for serious injury. Aside
from innumerable scratches and cuts from fallen
rock, the right arm was broken and he had a deep
gash across his thigh.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston set the arm expertly and treated
the wounds. Rhodes&rsquo; breathing had become steadier,
but he did not regain consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried,&rdquo; the Scout leader confessed to the
Scouts who anxiously hovered near. &ldquo;He should be
coming around unless he has a skull injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should we send to Bogota for a doctor?&rdquo; Ken
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would take more than a week, round trip.
By that time, Rhodes either will be much better, or
beyond help, I&rsquo;m afraid. We can send Jose, but I&rsquo;m
doubtful that it will do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Mr. Livingston and Jack with the patient,
the others sought their guide. He readily agreed to
go for a doctor, promising to return as quickly as
possible to the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you reach the village, report Appleby
Corning&rsquo;s absence,&rdquo; Ken urged. &ldquo;Ask the authorities
to send a search party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Senor</i>,&rdquo; Jose nodded.</p>
<p>He mounted a mule and rode away from the
mine, never to be seen by the Scouts again. An irresponsible
fellow, he pocketed the money they gave
him, and once well away from the area, promptly
forgot the mission on which he had been sent.</p>
<p>Left with Rhodes, Jack and Mr. Livingston remained
anxiously by the bedside. The patient tossed
and jerked restlessly, but his occasional mutterings
encouraged them to believe that he might yet recover
consciousness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes was in the kitchen when the engineer&rsquo;s
eyes opened for a moment. He stared blankly
into Jack&rsquo;s face, but without recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered, his voice bitter with
hatred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Livingston moved from the window to
join Jack at the bedside, the engineer again lapsed
into silence. The Scout leader stood watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming around, I think,&rdquo; he told Jack.
&ldquo;While he may be out of his head for awhile, this
is an encouraging sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, the patient became so
restless that he had to be restrained to keep him
from flinging off the bed covers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to stop me!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
back to the mine&mdash;Corning can&rsquo;t take over in my
place&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get him for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are at the mine,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston told him
patiently. &ldquo;Relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes fell back on the pillow, but only for a
moment. A crafty smile overspread his pallid face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos, you&rsquo;re a wicked <i>bandido</i>,&rdquo; he chuckled,
&ldquo;but so very stupid! Now you will do as I tell you,
we both will profit&mdash;at the expense of Senor Corning,
who hates us both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack and Mr. Livingston bent low to catch the
almost inaudible mutterings, Mrs. Rhodes came in
with a pitcher of water. She caught the mumbled
word &ldquo;Corning&rdquo; and stiffened alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband is conscious?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you call me at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seemed no need,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming around, but he&rsquo;s not himself yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about Corning and the bandit,
Carlos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhodes laughed nervously. &ldquo;His mind is
wandering. Why, he doesn&rsquo;t even know Carlos!&rdquo;
Setting the pitcher on the stand, she turned again
to the pair by the bedside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take over now, thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind staying,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You may
need us if he turns restless again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;ll call. I prefer to be alone with my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston agreed, with a nod to
Jack. &ldquo;If you want us, we&rsquo;ll be in our tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once well away from the cottage, the two discussed
the abrupt dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was afraid her husband would spill something,&rdquo;
Jack declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have learned a few things if we could
have stayed,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston agreed. &ldquo;This convinces
me Rhodes knows only too well what became
of Corning. It was no casual kidnapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Rhodes paid Carlos to pull off that raid!&rdquo;
Jack replied. &ldquo;He probably knows where Corning
is held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may. But Rhodes&rsquo; position here would be
most insecure should Corning escape and return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you figure if Rhodes planned the kidnapping,
he&rsquo;d want to see to it that your friend never got
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston nodded soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think Corning
already is out of the picture except for one
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Hap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos is a sly, treacherous fellow. Clever enough
to realize that alive, Corning could be a financial
asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could blackmail Rhodes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack, I figure if Carlos is wholly unscrupulous,
that&rsquo;s what he may do. So I half expect a ransom
demand, but upon Rhodes&mdash;not the mine
owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve been waiting here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partially. I&rsquo;m hoping Carlos presently will show
his hand. If we can get a clue, he may lead us to
the hide-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Rhodes laid up, the situation has changed!&rdquo;
Jack chuckled. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be sending us away today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and we&rsquo;ll have a chance to talk to Phillipe.
Let&rsquo;s do it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner was not at his hut. However, they
found him at the mine. No work was being done.
Tons of rock and dirt had fallen into the pit, and
must be moved before emeralds again could be
mined. Disinterested, the men sat about, smoking
and talking. From the general tone of the conversation,
the Scouts gathered that no one grieved because
of Rhodes&rsquo; accident.</p>
<p>Drawing Phillipe aside, Mr. Livingston and Jack
questioned him again as to the bandit raid. The
miner repeated his previous story. He talked more
freely however, and nodded wisely when Jack
hinted that the kidnapping might have been plotted
by Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why Rhodes is so keen on
being in charge here,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston went on. &ldquo;The
vein of emeralds seems to be playing out. At least,
that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, Senor. But greater riches not far from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re speaking of the lost Spanish mine?&rdquo; the
Scout leader interposed alertly. &ldquo;We saw a map in
Rhodes&rsquo; office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Corning spend many weeks searching for
mine. He make big mistake in telling Senor Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why Rhodes was so eager to get back
here!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston exclaimed. &ldquo;At last I begin to
see the picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>, Senor, he find it by following Senor Corning&rsquo;s
map. Then he change map, so no one else find
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains why Rhodes left the map lying
around so carelessly,&rdquo; Jack commented. &ldquo;He figured
that if anyone tried to use it, they&rsquo;d be mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phillipe, who besides Mr. Corning and Rhodes
knows the location of the old Spanish mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only me, Senor. I follow Senor Rhodes across
river, into wilderness. Learn secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phillipe, could you take us to this mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very difficult trip, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could guide us there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Senor.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it worth your while. How far is the
mine from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far, Senor, but way hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can we start?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Phillipe said reluctantly.</p>
<p>It was obvious he had no zest for the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Senor. Trip very long. Bad to be on trail over
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be on the safe side, we&rsquo;ll take a tent and light
camping equipment,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston decided.
&ldquo;Jack, only you and Ken are to go with us. Phillipe,
be ready at dawn, and tell no one where we are
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Rhodes make trouble if he finds out!&rdquo; the
miner warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes needn&rsquo;t know about this little trip,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston answered. &ldquo;Anyway, he&rsquo;s in no condition
right now to ask any questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations rapidly went forward for the next
day&rsquo;s expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all goes well, we should be back here by tomorrow
night,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston told Willie and War.
&ldquo;Once I&rsquo;ve learned the location of the lost mine, I&rsquo;ll
have a leverage over Rhodes. I think then, if he
regains his sense, I can force him to tell me the truth
about Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes is coming around all right,&rdquo; Willie reported.
&ldquo;I was up to the cottage a few minutes ago.
He was sitting up in bed, guzzling soup.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man has the constitution of an ox,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about him.
He&rsquo;ll come through in fine shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work fast while he&rsquo;s laid up,&rdquo; asserted
Jack. &ldquo;Once he begins to regain his strength,
he&rsquo;ll start tightening up on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, Mr. Livingston and the Scouts revisited
the engineer. Very much himself again, he
was in an ugly mood. Not even thanking them for
their efforts in saving his life, he said gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife tells me you&rsquo;re packing your stuff.
Leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a day,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not crazy enough to venture out into the
bush in search of your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be crazy?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure would! I tell you that if you&rsquo;ll wait, there
may be a ransom demand.&rdquo; Sudden suspicion shone
in Rhodes&rsquo; dark eyes. &ldquo;Say, maybe this excursion of
yours doesn&rsquo;t concern your friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston made no answer. He and the
Scouts already were turning toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute!&rdquo; the engineer called sharply. With
an effort, he half pulled himself from the bed. &ldquo;If
you have anything else in mind, I&rsquo;m warning you to
lay off or it may cost you your lives! I&rsquo;m ordering
you to stay here in camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston smiled. &ldquo;First you order us to
leave. Now you order us to stay. Can&rsquo;t you make up
your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking advantage of me while I&rsquo;m flat on
my back!&rdquo; Rhodes snarled. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not fooling
me one bit. I may be cooped up here, but I&rsquo;m not
stupid. I know what you&rsquo;re about. And I&rsquo;m giving
you a last warning! Stay in camp, or you&rsquo;ll regret it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston and the Scouts did not hear the
final threat. Leaving the man to his tirade, they
quietly closed the bedroom door and left the
cottage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 18</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DISASTER</span></h2>
<p>When the Scout party, led by Phillipe, slipped out
of camp shortly after dawn the next morning, they
saw Rhodes at the cottage window.</p>
<p>He sat in a big chair, wrapped in blankets. Obviously,
he had posted himself there to watch, and
was well aware of their intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not fooling him one bit,&rdquo; remarked Ken.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent he&rsquo;ll have one of his men keep track
of us. He&rsquo;d stop us if he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once well away from the mining camp, the Scouts
doubled back to the river. The stream, fed by recent
rains higher in the mountains, raced as fast as a mill
stream.</p>
<p>Phillipe guided the party to a log bridge crossing.
There Ken, Jack and Mr. Livingston parted with the
other Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return to camp and wait for us,&rdquo; the Scout
leader instructed Willie and Warwick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make
a fast trip to see what we can discover.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes probably won&rsquo;t be able to get out of the
cottage,&rdquo; Jack added. &ldquo;But if he does, keep an eye
on him. Especially watch to see if he flashes any
more of those mysterious signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Willie promised. &ldquo;How long will you be
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all goes well, we should be back in camp by
nightfall. But don&rsquo;t worry if we&rsquo;re delayed. The
going will be rough, and the trip may take longer
than we expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing the narrow, log bridge, Phillipe and the
three explorers lost themselves in the dense vegetation.
For hours, they hacked their way through
tough creepers, and at times were compelled to chop
down small saplings.</p>
<p>By noon, as the party rested and ate a cold lunch,
it was difficult for the Scouts to maintain their customary
good cheer. Although accustomed to hard,
outdoor work, the boys suffered from strained
muscles and aching backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making about a mile every two hours,&rdquo;
Ken calculated gloomily. &ldquo;Maybe less. Phillipe, are
you sure you&rsquo;re taking us the right way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This the way,&rdquo; the miner replied. &ldquo;Trail very
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After resting, the Scouts forced themselves to
continue, though they had long ago lost zest for the
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Phillipe seemed to know exactly where he was
headed, yet as the day wore on, the Explorers began
to lose faith that he ever could lead them to the lost
Spanish mine. Then, the little miner seemed to become
less certain. They saw him studying the ridges
with puzzled eyes, and occasionally shaking his head
as if confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phillipe doesn&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; Ken
said to Jack as the party made another halt. &ldquo;The
vegetation has closed in since he saw that mine.
This trip was a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillipe would not admit confusion. But after
another hour of hard labor had brought them to a
relatively clear area overlooking the river, he had
to admit defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry, Senor,&rdquo; he apologized to Mr. Livingston.</p>
<p>Phillipe&rsquo;s regret was so genuine that the Scouts
could not believe that he had betrayed them deliberately.
His intentions, undoubtedly, had been
good. Given several days to search, they might find
the lost mine. But in the present circumstance, the
quest must be abandoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we&rsquo;d followed directions on that map,&rdquo;
Willie remarked regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result would have been the same,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the markings were altered.
We&rsquo;ll rest awhile and start back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously, the Scouts noted how fast the sun was
lowering. The return trip, of course, would be much
easier. Even so, it would be nightfall before they
reached the Last Chance mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>After resting for awhile, Jack arose to hack at the
rocks with a pick. Among the fragments were a few
tiny green specks. But there was no fire in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be close to the old vein,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Too bad we can&rsquo;t camp and try again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed questioningly at Mr. Livingston. The
Scout leader hesitated, then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could find that old mine, Jack. But
time is running out on us. We must get back to camp
and devote all our energy to finding Mr. Corning,
if he still is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How we going to do it?&rdquo; Ken asked in despair.
&ldquo;Rhodes may have the answer, but he won&rsquo;t help us.
As you pointed out, Hap, it&rsquo;s hopeless to undertake
a search in this wild country unless one has a definite
clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clues, I&rsquo;m afraid, never will be forthcoming.
Our only one&mdash;those flashing signals&mdash;aren&rsquo;t much
to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the program?&rdquo; Jack questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get back to camp, we&rsquo;ll start for the village
to notify the authorities. They may organize a
search, though I haven&rsquo;t much hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes is the key to the whole situation,&rdquo; Ken
insisted. &ldquo;If only we could force him to talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a forlorn hope too, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the Scout
leader answered. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d found this old mine, we
might have used our knowledge as a leverage. Having
failed, I don&rsquo;t see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>After hacking awhile at the outcropping of rock,
Jack walked down to the river&rsquo;s edge. Foam was
back-washing against the boulders and the current
was very swift.</p>
<p>He stood there a moment, fascinated by the speed
of the wild torrent. Intending to rejoin his friends,
he chose a way different from the one he had come.
Soon he regretted it, finding himself in a mat of
dense vegetation.</p>
<p>As he hacked a path, he felt his footing give beneath
him. Unexpectedly, the floor of creepers dissolved.</p>
<p>Down he plunged, uttering a terrified shriek as
he fell!</p>
<p>Jack struck solid earth some distance below.
Stunned by the suddenness of the fall as well as the
impact, he lay for a moment, unable to move.</p>
<p>Then gingerly, he sat up. No bones had been
broken. He felt for his flashlight and was relieved to
discover it intact.</p>
<p>The beam of light disclosed that he had fallen into
a cave-like hole perhaps ten feet below the surface
of the ridge above.</p>
<p>Slowly, Jack pulled himself to an upright position,
discovering that he could stand without stooping.
It was then that he made an exciting discovery.</p>
<p>The ceiling overhead had a distinct curve!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like part of an old tunnel!&rdquo; he thought
in elation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Before Jack could investigate further, he heard
a shout from above.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston peered down through the narrow
opening, calling anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a scratch,&rdquo; the Scout replied with a
chuckle. &ldquo;This is a deep hole though, and I can&rsquo;t get
out by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston directed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a rope and haul you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in too big a hurry, Hap. I want to look
around a bit while I&rsquo;m here. It appears to me that
I&rsquo;ve fallen into a tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tunnel, Jack? What makes you think so?&rdquo; The
tone of Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s voice plainly disclosed that
the information had startled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no cave. The walls have been hewn, and
the ceiling is arched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be the lost mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect so,&rdquo; Jack agreed cheerfully. &ldquo;While
you&rsquo;re getting that rope, I&rsquo;ll see what I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Venturing forward, the youth flashed his light
over one of the side walls. Distinctly, he could make
out ancient pick marks.</p>
<p>That the tunnel was an old one he no longer had
the slightest doubt. Mr. Livingston had told him
that the Spaniards, being amateurs at mining, had
used the tunnel method in their quest for emeralds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Focusing his beam ahead of him, he walked until
his way was blocked by earth and debris. Unable
to proceed farther, he returned to find his friends
anxiously lowering a knotted rope through the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the lost mine!&rdquo; Jack reported jubilantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring up a handful of emeralds,&rdquo; Ken shouted
with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toss down a pick and I&rsquo;ll try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for exploration,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
objected. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mighty lucky to have found the
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be the one Corning mapped,&rdquo; Ken
commented. &ldquo;It looks like an old Spanish tunnel
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mine same one Senor Corning find,&rdquo; Phillipe
asserted. &ldquo;Senor Rhodes later on cover vein with
earth and rock to hide it and keep gems safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That debris certainly looked as if it might have
been piled on deliberately,&rdquo; Jack informed the group
above. &ldquo;Lower a pick and I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persuaded against his better judgment, Mr. Livingston
lowered the requested tool. Phillipe also
went down by means of the rope.</p>
<p>He and Jack removed some of the loose debris,
exposing a streak of rock, narrow but with a well-defined
green color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;We strike vein,&rdquo; Phillipe said, resting for a
moment from his labors. &ldquo;If emeralds form, they big
ones I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they labored, taking turns with pick and crowbar.
Above, Mr. Livingston and Ken warned them
that the day fast was waning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the mine and that&rsquo;s the important
thing.&rdquo; the Scout leader called down impatiently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll mark it well, and hope we can return. Now
we must leave or we&rsquo;ll never reach camp tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep in the earth, Jack and Phillipe scarcely
heard. In a fever of excitement, they sensed that
they were on the verge of a great discovery.</p>
<p>Phillipe struck again with his bar, using infinite
skill. The sharp point split the rock neatly, exposing
a section of dark green beryl. Embedded in it were
several large, well-formed emeralds.</p>
<p>Phillipe sucked in his breath. &ldquo;Senor,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;Great wealth is here! A fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack scooped out the emeralds, examining them
in the beam of the flashlight. All were perfect gems,
dark green, with a deep smoldering fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, you hold great riches in your hand,&rdquo; Phillipe
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleby Corning&rsquo;s ransom perhaps.&rdquo; Hypnotized
by the warm glow of the gems, Jack turned them
over and over in his palm.</p>
<p>He was brought from his reverie by an echoing
shout from above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; It was Mr. Livingston who called. &ldquo;Get up
here! It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>
<p>Swiftly he and Phillipe recovered the vein with
earth and by means of the rope climbed out of the
tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, do you realize how late it is?&rdquo; Ken greeted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; Jack asked, still in a land of
enchantment. &ldquo;We found the mine, didn&rsquo;t we? And
look at this!&rdquo; He flashed the handful of emeralds.</p>
<p>In awe, the others examined the treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re first quality gems, or I&rsquo;m no judge,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston asserted. &ldquo;No wonder Rhodes wants to
reestablish himself here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he knows the value of the vein?&rdquo; Jack
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must. I believe it was because of this vein
that he went to so much trouble to set himself up
in Corning&rsquo;s place. He&rsquo;s kept the knowledge from
the miners and probably from company officials,
hoping to profit personally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spike his little game,&rdquo; Jack chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded. &ldquo;The important
thing now is to get back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast,&rdquo; Ken added, with an uneasy glance at the
lowering sun. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t possibly make it by dark
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Before starting back, the Scouts carefully disguised
the hole through which Jack had fallen,
marking the locality. The work completed, they
shouldered their packs and started off at a fast pace.</p>
<p>Though the return trip was much easier, darkness
soon overtook them. Doggedly they followed the
stream which rushed over the rocks in a foaming,
angry torrent.</p>
<p>Unwilling to waste even a moment, the party did
not pause to prepare supper. Aching in every
muscle, the Scouts nevertheless kept moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be coming to the log bridge?&rdquo; Ken
complained after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it,&rdquo; Jack said, halting to shift his pack.
&ldquo;Around this next bend, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realization that the long trek was nearing its end
gave the four renewed strength. On they went
through the darkness. The night air was cold and
very still, and the only sound that of the rushing
torrent.</p>
<p>Phillipe, who was a little ahead of the other three,
abruptly halted. He uttered a grunt of surprise and
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston demanded.</p>
<p>Receiving no answer, he and the Scouts pressed
quickly on.</p>
<p>They came upon Phillipe standing on the rocks,
staring at the racing stream. For a moment, they
could not comprehend the reason for his dead
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t this the place where we crossed this
morning?&rdquo; Jack finally asked, noting several vaguely
familiar landmarks.</p>
<p>Phillipe inclined his head. &ldquo;Same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; burst out Ken. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridge gone. Swept away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke as the full import of Phillipe&rsquo;s words
soaked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; Jack finally echoed in a faint voice. &ldquo;That
means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stay here,&rdquo; Phillipe said, sinking wearily
down on a flat rock. &ldquo;There is no other bridge&mdash;no
way to cross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 19</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A RACING STREAM</span></h2>
<p>The situation, though alarming, did not dismay
Mr. Livingston or the two Scouts. Knowing that the
washed-out log bridge was not far from the mining
camp, they reasoned that Willie and War soon
would become aware of their plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stranded here for awhile, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston commented, staring at the foaming
waters. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy to build another bridge
across that span.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming that Rhodes will assign his men to the
task,&rdquo; added Ken gloomily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably be
tickled pink that we&rsquo;re bottled up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer that bridge went out just when it did,&rdquo;
muttered Jack. &ldquo;It seemed sturdy and secure early
this morning when we passed over. Guess the current
must be even stronger than we figured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>For an hour, the Scouts took turns flashing signals
with their lights. The distant mining camp was completely
blocked from view by trees and rocks. They
had little hope that the flashes would be seen, but
did think that War and Willie, alarmed by their
long absence, might venture toward the river to
investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bushed,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston declared, after
the effort to attract attention had proved futile.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to sleep. In the morning, we can find a
way to get help or to rescue ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Phillipe&rsquo;s example, Ken and Jack
sought shelter. The night was bitterly cold. Nevertheless,
in their thickly lined sleeping bags, they
spent fairly comfortable hours.</p>
<p>When they awakened at dawn, Mr. Livingston
had the fire built, and was preparing a hot breakfast.</p>
<p>Stretching their cramped limbs, Jack and Ken
went down to the river to wash.</p>
<p>As they bent down to dash the icy water on their
faces, the torrent rushed past, foaming and hissing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stream is plenty swift,&rdquo; Ken remarked. &ldquo;Too
deep to wade across, and a fellow couldn&rsquo;t hope to
swim it, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rapids and whirlpools below here,&rdquo; Jack reminded
him. &ldquo;Rhodes told me that. He probably was
telling the truth too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s darn funny War and Willie don&rsquo;t take any
interest in what became of us,&rdquo; Ken went on, scanning
the rugged shoreline. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think
they&rsquo;d see the smoke from our fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not up yet,&rdquo; Jack rejoined with forced
cheer. &ldquo;You know how War is&mdash;with no one to pull
him out of bed, he&rsquo;d sleep until noon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, he and Willie must have realized that
something went wrong with our plans. Common
sense would tell &rsquo;em we&rsquo;re in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, Ken. You remember, Mr. Livingston
told them we might be gone over night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bothers me, is how are they going to help
us even after they discover our situation? One can&rsquo;t
build a bridge in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to risk a raft probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe be swept down into the whirlpool.
No thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Explorers rejoined Mr. Livingston and
Phillipe, who were dishing up breakfast. The meal
revived everyone&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Jack questioned the Scout
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send up some smoke signals,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
advised. &ldquo;That should draw attention to our
plight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning was clear and windless. Knowing
that a column of smoke would rise high, the Scouts
were hopeful that despite the rim of mountain
peaks, it would be visible at the mining camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War and Willie will soon know we&rsquo;re in trouble,&rdquo;
Ken asserted, starting to gather an armful of dry
twigs.</p>
<p>Jack already was accumulating a pile of green
leaves and had dampened a blanket at the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>With everything in readiness, the group built up
their fire and when it was burning briskly, threw on
the leaves. A heavy column of smoke arose.</p>
<p>After a moment, Jack and Ken interrupted the
smoke by means of the blanket. Over and over they
flashed a distress signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be getting a reply soon now,&rdquo; Jack
asserted, anxiously scanning the sky in the direction
of the mining camp.</p>
<p>For fifteen minutes, the Scouts kept up the signals.
Then, as the smoke column faded away, they
continued to watch for a response. None came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our signals must have been seen at the camp,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston declared. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it.
What&rsquo;s happened to War and Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More disturbed than at any time since they had
found themselves stranded, the Scout leader went
down to the stream&rsquo;s edge. He studied the swift
current and then directed attention to the spot
where the log bridge had washed out. Only a few
broken wires remained. These he carefully examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bridge didn&rsquo;t wash out,&rdquo; he told Jack, who
had followed him over the slippery rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was weakened deliberately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way, Jack.&rdquo; Mr. Livingston showed
him where the wires had been snipped with a cutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d guess so. He may be on his feet by this time,
or he could have ordered his men to let the bridge
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie and War wouldn&rsquo;t have stood for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if they could have prevented it. But they
haven&rsquo;t answered our smoke signals. I&rsquo;m afraid they
may be in trouble too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might suit Rhodes very well to have us
stranded on this side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know he didn&rsquo;t swallow our story about looking
for Appleby Corning,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded.
&ldquo;He must have suspected we were searching for the
old mine. Now he intends to keep us stranded until
he and his wife can get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stranded, all right,&rdquo; Jack muttered, staring
at the boiling waters. &ldquo;No big trees close by, even
if we could fell one and cross on its trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here much longer,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said. &ldquo;Willie and War may need us as much as we
need them. We&rsquo;ve got to get back to camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A raft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our best bet, I think. We&rsquo;re all good swimmers,
with exception of Phillipe. The current is
swift, but I think we can make it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>The Scouts set to work, pegging out a rounded
shape, somewhat smaller than a waterproof tarp included
in their equipment. This accomplished, they
used dry twigs and small pieces of wood to fill in
between the pegs, and lashed it all firmly together
with stout twine.</p>
<p>Next, they built a floor of webbed sticks and then
removed the pegs. Finally the bundle was slid onto
the waterproof tarp which was lashed securely in
place around the circle. As the last step, they attached
a long rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad little raft,&rdquo; Jack declared, surveying
the finished job. &ldquo;She should carry one of us at a
time without trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston offered to go first, but the others
would not have it so. Jack insisted that he was the
strongest swimmer, and after some argument, the
Scout leader reluctantly agreed that he might make
the initial trip. Phillipe, meanwhile, had hacked out
a crude paddle.</p>
<p>With Ken and Mr. Livingston holding an end of
the rope, Jack settled himself firmly on the circular
tarp raft, and shoved off.</p>
<p>The fast current caught the craft, whirling it. For
a minute, Jack was afraid he was going under. Icy
water splashed over his legs. The awkward craft
twisted and turned in the grasp of the racing stream.</p>
<p>Paddling desperately, he regained control. Without
disaster, he reached the opposite shore, though
some distance down stream. Ken, Phillipe and Mr.
Livingston promptly pulled the raft back to their
side of the shore. The Scout leader next made the
trip across, followed by Ken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Phillipe, desperately afraid of the racing water,
had to be coaxed before he too attempted the
stream.</p>
<p>All went well until the miner was close to shore.
Then unexpectedly, the make-shift paddle snapped,
leaving him with a useless stub of wood.</p>
<p>A gasp of horror escaped his lips as the current
viciously seized the little craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the rope!&rdquo; shouted Jack, running along
the jagged rocks at the stream&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Paralyzed with fear, Phillipe sat frozen. He fancied
he could hear the roar of rapids below and was
certain he would be swept to his doom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the rope!&rdquo; Jack yelled again. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recovering from paralysis, Phillipe suddenly
hurled the free end toward shore. His throw was
powerful. To the relief of the Scouts, the rope fell
on the rocks, and they were able to seize it. Fighting
the current, they slowly pulled the raft to safety.</p>
<p>Dripping wet and shivering from terror, Phillipe
stumbled out onto shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gracias Senors</i>,&rdquo; he mumbled, collapsing in a
shivering heap. &ldquo;You save my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have saved you a wild ride down the
canyon,&rdquo; Jack conceded as he salvaged the water-soaked
tarp. &ldquo;This rope is badly frayed. A few more
hard jerks against the sharp rocks and it would have
been cut in half.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>After wringing out their damp clothes, the Scouts
started for the mining camp. Passing the locked,
deserted office, they went on to the tent area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fire,&rdquo; Ken observed from a distance. &ldquo;No one
around, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slightly in advance of the others, he went quickly
to the tent occupied by Willie and War. Everything
was in order. But no one was there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jack and Mr. Livingston had been
looking around outside. The fire, they noted in
alarm, had been dead many hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Jack demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened
to War and Willie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes must know!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asserted, his
voice grim. &ldquo;Come on fellows! We&rsquo;re going to have
a show-down with him right now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 20</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MISSING SCOUTS</span></h2>
<p>The Scouts found the mining engineer at the
cottage, breakfasting with his wife. Though somewhat
pale, Rhodes looked much better, and was
able to be about. His right arm remained in a splint,
but he managed his coffee cup fairly well with his
left one.</p>
<p>As the three came to the screen door, the engineer&rsquo;s
first look of shocked surprise revealed very
plainly that he had not expected their return so soon.</p>
<p>Quickly recovering, however, he invited them in.
&ldquo;Have some coffee?&rdquo; he offered with more cordiality
than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston spoke shortly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to learn what became of War and
Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; the engineer shrugged. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
seen them since they left camp last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t start for Bogota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like them to start off anywhere without
leaving word. Which way did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then they couldn&rsquo;t have gone off in search of
us,&rdquo; Ken replied. The remark slipped out before he
considered how it would be taken.</p>
<p>Rhodes regarded him steadily as he reached for
another muffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t go off in quest of your friend,
Corning after all?&rdquo; the engineer inquired in a soft,
faintly amused tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well where we went!&rdquo; Jack accused,
losing his temper. &ldquo;You thought you&rsquo;d arrange
things too so we wouldn&rsquo;t get back until it
suited your convenience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, young
man. Suppose you explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly. You weakened the log bridge so it
washed out, leaving us stranded on the other side
of the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were you doing over there?&rdquo; the engineer
questioned insolently. &ldquo;Searching for your
friend Corning, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston had seated himself at the breakfast
table, opposite Rhodes and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to hide anything,&rdquo; he informed
the engineer quietly. &ldquo;Frankly, we were trying to
find the old Spanish emerald mine that Corning
came upon some months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Rhodes laughed unpleasantly. &ldquo;I suspected as
much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every greenhorn that comes to
Colombia falls for those romantic tales about lost
mines. Corning was as big a sucker as anyone. But
he never found the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am. He fell heir to an old map when
he took over here. But it was worthless. If the
Spaniards ever mined in this area, the emeralds are
pretty well gone, except in this pit we&rsquo;re working
now. Any day it will play out. Then the mine is
finished and should be closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to this?&rdquo; Carelessly, Mr. Livingston
dropped a large emerald on the table.</p>
<p>Both Rhodes and his wife gasped as they saw the
handsome green stone. In the morning sunlight, it
burned with a rich fire and appeared flawless.</p>
<p>Carefully, the engineer examined the gem. For a
long moment, he did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; the Scout leader prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you found the old mine after all?&rdquo; Rhodes
returned, his eyes glittering. &ldquo;Or shall we say you
were guided there? You never could have come
upon it by your own efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we have discovered the mine&mdash;apparently,
a rich one. The Last Chance should take
on new life now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. One emerald doesn&rsquo;t
make a mine, you know. I&rsquo;ll send this sample to
Bogota to be assayed. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll put the men
over there, opening up a new pit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Ken and Jack were rather dismayed at Rhodes&rsquo;
proposal that he keep the emerald. To their surprise,
Mr. Livingston appeared to fall in with the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can the emerald be taken to the
Bogota office?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife had planned to return there today or
tomorrow. She can take the gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid to have her travel alone with a
valuable stone? She might meet Carlos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear of him,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhodes spoke up
quickly. &ldquo;Anyway, I have a means of carrying the
gem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll start early tomorrow,&rdquo; her husband interrupted,
deliberately cutting her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have one of my boys go along,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said, off hand. &ldquo;Corning&rsquo;s disappearance must
be reported to the authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife can take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to have a Scout along. Besides, your
wife should have someone with her on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes started to protest, then seemed to think
better of it. &ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; he shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Willie and War,&rdquo; the Scout leader resumed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll send out a searching party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Rhodes snapped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running
a mine&mdash;not a kindergarten. I didn&rsquo;t ask you and
your party to come here! You&rsquo;ve interfered with
operations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did discover the old mine, don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that! You didn&rsquo;t make such an important
discovery. I&rsquo;ve always known&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known the location for some little time?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston quietly supplied. &ldquo;Perhaps that was
why you were so eager to get back here again as
engineer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; Rhodes denied. &ldquo;Now get out of
here, will you? Let me finish my breakfast in peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have disturbed you,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
returned. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and the two Scouts left the cottage. Once they
were well beyond hearing, Jack and Ken anxiously
questioned their leader as to his plan of procedure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it may have been a mistake to
let Rhodes have that emerald?&rdquo; Ken demanded. &ldquo;It
must have high value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever its worth, Ken, the gem belongs to the
mining company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but will Mrs. Rhodes turn it over to agents
in Bogota or Cartagena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing I want to learn, Ken. I have a
hunch Rhodes doesn&rsquo;t want to reveal to company
officials that the old mine has been located. If his
wife delivers the emerald, it will be a dead give-away
because any expert will know immediately that
the gem didn&rsquo;t come from the Last Chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she fails to turn it in?&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be enough to arouse company officials.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re figuring Rhodes and his wife may be
forced to show their hand one way or the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch Rhodes is trying to bleed this
mine for his own benefit,&rdquo; the Scout leader replied.
&ldquo;His decision to open a pit at the new mine before
the sample is assayed, convinces me of that. He figures
on working the vein fast, and getting out with
what he can before the company clamps down on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before Corning is found, either dead or
alive,&rdquo; supplied Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I see it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded.
&ldquo;Unless Willie or War can be found in the next few
hours, you must go to Bogota with Mrs. Rhodes,
Jack. See that she turns the emerald over to company
officials. Report Corning&rsquo;s disappearance, and
that Willie and War are missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may take some doing, Jack. I&rsquo;ve been told
they maintain a hands-off policy with respect to this
mine. There&rsquo;s one thing you can do. When you reach
Bogota, rent a plane and fly back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly? There&rsquo;s no possible landing place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. You&rsquo;re to survey the area, especially Emerald
Valley in the locality where we saw those flashing
signals. See if you can spot anything remotely
resembling a bandit hide-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the air that might be done! If I see anything
suspicious, I&rsquo;ll drop a message!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to spare you for the trip, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
went on anxiously. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no other way
unless we get a trace of Willie and War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an attempt to gather some information about
the missing pair, the Scouts talked to several of the
miners. They were able to confirm that Willie and
War had left camp the previous night, starting down
trail with only light equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something important must have come up,&rdquo; Ken
said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s mighty queer they left no word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Mr. Livingston, the Scouts searched the
camp thoroughly without finding even a clue as to
the strange disappearance. Nor could the missing
boys be sighted through field glasses. Ken was in
favor of seeking them afoot, but the trail had not
been marked. If Willie and War had left the main
path to wander in the bush, they might be hopelessly
lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m depending upon their good common sense,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston asserted. &ldquo;They know the dangers.
If we wait a few hours, I think they may come dragging
in under their own steam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>As the morning wore on, the Scouts fretted at delay,
yet acknowledged that hasty action would accomplish
nothing. Rhodes, meanwhile, spurred by
their discovery of the old Spanish mine, had put
men to work rebuilding the washed out bridge.
Watching the engineer direct the laborers, the
Scouts lost some of their conviction that he previously
had weakened the structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that bridge did go out by itself,&rdquo; Jack
remarked to Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it! He&rsquo;s putting on a show for
our benefit. Anyway, he&rsquo;s anxious to dig emeralds in
a new pit now that he knows we&rsquo;ve uncovered the
vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After watching the bridge building for awhile, the
two Scouts rejoined their leader. Mr. Livingston had
just returned from down-trail where he unsuccessfully
had sought clues with respect to the disappearance
of their chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs anywhere along the path,&rdquo; he reported
in discouragement. &ldquo;Apparently, when they left,
they were confident they could get back without any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncertain what to do, the Scouts kept close watch
of the trail as the morning wore on. They were discussing
the possibility of a mule-back search, when
Jack suddenly cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I think they&rsquo;re coming now!&rdquo; Excitedly, he
pointed down through the dense trees hemming
much of the winding trail.</p>
<p>The three watchers glued their eyes on a visible
stretch of path some distance below. Before Mr.
Livingston could adjust his field glasses, the two
missing Scouts were sighted trudging wearily around
a bend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s War and Willie all right!&rdquo; Jack shouted in
relief. &ldquo;Safe and sound too! Who do they think they
are, anyhow, scaring the living daylights out of us?
I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston smiled, but shook his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be too hasty,&rdquo; he advised as the three started down
the trail to meet the truants. &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken,
War and Willie probably had a good reason for taking
off from camp. Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em a chance to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 21</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A MISSION</span></h2>
<p>Spent from the long, hard climb up the steep trail,
War and Willie nevertheless greeted the other
Scouts with good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you fellows been?&rdquo; Ken demanded as the
party retired to the shelter of the tents. &ldquo;We thought
you were lost on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be that dumb?&rdquo; War
scoffed, flinging himself down near the fire which
Jack had rekindled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of truth, we were lost for a little
while,&rdquo; Willie admitted with a laugh. &ldquo;We went exploring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very risky thing to do in this country,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston chided. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have left
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we know that now,&rdquo; War agreed. &ldquo;But we
had to find out the hard way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened after we left?&rdquo; Ken questioned
impatiently. &ldquo;You started off in search of us&mdash;or
were you hoping to find Mr. Corning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was like this,&rdquo; War said, stirring the fire with
a stick. &ldquo;Last night, shortly after dusk, we saw those
signals again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light flashes?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; War nodded, &ldquo;only the signals didn&rsquo;t
come from this camp. They were being flashed from
half way down to the valley floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t look more than a mile or so away,&rdquo; Willie
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; prompted Mr. Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we watched &rsquo;em for a minute or two. Someone
down below kept sending three long flashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any answer from this camp?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Willie told him. &ldquo;We figured that with
Rhodes confined in the cottage, there wouldn&rsquo;t be
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t catch the flashes?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently, not. At any rate, he didn&rsquo;t leave the
cottage,&rdquo; Willie replied. &ldquo;Probably wasn&rsquo;t feeling up
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you decided to investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looked like a perfect opportunity,&rdquo; Willie
confessed sheepishly. &ldquo;It proved to be a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>War took up the story. &ldquo;Not very much, Hap,&rdquo; he
admitted. &ldquo;We took careful note of those flashes and
started off down the trail. After awhile, the fellow
who was signaling, gave up. We had nothing to
guide us. We thought we had a good idea where the
signals originated, but at night the forest all looks
pretty much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got lost?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean, not exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; War grinned, &ldquo;we did come upon a path
that led off into the forest from the main trail. We
decided to follow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it take you?&rdquo; Ken interposed. &ldquo;To the
middle of nowhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; War acknowledged. &ldquo;It
just kept on and on, and after awhile, we decided
we&rsquo;d have to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d marked you way, I take it?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in a fashion,&rdquo; War answered, avoiding the
Scout leader&rsquo;s direct gaze. &ldquo;We figured we couldn&rsquo;t
go astray following a regular path. But somehow in
the semi-darkness, we slipped up and got off the
darn thing. Getting back was what took so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to wait until dawn,&rdquo; Willie confessed.
&ldquo;Once it was daylight, we figured things out, and
were able to retrace our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you used your head on that point,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said. &ldquo;Your excursion, I take it, netted no
real information.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scrap,&rdquo; War acknowledged ruefully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
almost certain though, that that path we started to
follow must lead to either a village or to the bandit
hide-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; the Scout leader nodded.
&ldquo;It confirms my own opinion that we can do nothing
without definite information and assistance from the
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then told Willie and War what had happened
during their absence from camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes leaves tomorrow for Bogota with
the sample emerald to be assayed,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Willie,
if you and War are up to it, I&rsquo;d like you both to
go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be okay after a few hours sleep,&rdquo; Willie replied
at once. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston outlined the proposal he previously
had made to Jack. The two Scouts were to accompany
Mrs. Rhodes, and without arousing her
suspicion, make certain that she delivered the emerald
to company officials. Once the mission was
accomplished, they were to charter a plane and fly
back over the area in an attempt to locate the bandit
hide-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a plane, you should be able to scout the entire
area in a matter of hours,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston declared.
&ldquo;By mule or afoot it would be a hopeless
task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we&rsquo;ve surveyed the area, then what?&rdquo; War
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t land here. Your job done, you&rsquo;re to
drop a message and return to the nearest landing
field. Bogota probably. If your information warrants
it, try to get authorities to organize a search
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe Mr. Corning still is alive?&rdquo; Willie
asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Until we have proof otherwise, I&rsquo;ll assume
he is being held captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; War asked with a drowsy
yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after dawn tomorrow. Get some sleep now.
You&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie and War promptly turned in and fell at
once into heavy slumber. When they awakened in
late afternoon, Jack was preparing a hearty supper
over the camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; Willie asked, ambling over. &ldquo;I feel
like Rip Van Winkle&mdash;all out of touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very exciting,&rdquo; Jack reported. &ldquo;Rhodes
finished getting up the bridge. Late this afternoon,
the miners started digging at the tunnel across the
river. Our orders are to stay in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want you to see what&rsquo;s going on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the size of it,&rdquo; Jack nodded, squatting by
the fire. &ldquo;He pretended it was all news to him, our
finding that old vein. But he sort of let it slip later
that he&rsquo;d uncovered it himself, probably by using
Corning&rsquo;s map.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which he cunningly redrew, to keep others from
learning the exact location,&rdquo; Ken contributed. &ldquo;Now
that we&rsquo;ve tumbled to his secret, he&rsquo;s decided to dig
emeralds as fast as he can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he found many at the new site?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He claims not,&rdquo; Jack said, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s only his
story. We know the emeralds are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston joined the Scouts at the fire.
&ldquo;Rhodes, I suspect, intends to clean up what he can
for himself, and pull out,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;So far as I
know, the company isn&rsquo;t even aware that he&rsquo;s seized
control here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, we ought to put a little crimp in his
plans,&rdquo; Willie muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you and War fit into the picture,&rdquo;
the Scout leader nodded. &ldquo;When you get to Bogota,
talk to company officials. We have no proof of
Rhodes&rsquo; treachery, so you&rsquo;ll have to be careful. Use
your best judgment, and don&rsquo;t let Mrs. Rhodes
catch on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a responsibility,&rdquo; War said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do all right,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston assured him.
&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t tip your hand too soon, because Mrs.
Rhodes and Ferd Baronni probably are working together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of you intend to stay here and keep
watch of Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a hunch he&rsquo;ll over-play himself before
long,&rdquo; the Scout leader declared. Taking a roll
of bills from his leather fold, he gave them to War.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But use it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope we don&rsquo;t run into Carlos on the trail,&rdquo;
War replied, placing the money in a belt at his
waist. &ldquo;That boy has taking ways! I&rsquo;d hate to be
robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a risk that must be taken,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said. &ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes will be carrying the emerald&mdash;and
that might be quite an attraction. Just be cautious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; War promised soberly. &ldquo;All the same,
I&rsquo;d feel better if the rest of you were going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts ate the tasty supper Jack had prepared.
After the camp work had been done, they
wandered down to the river to inspect the new
bridge. On the way back, as a gesture of courtesy,
they stopped briefly at the cottage to discuss the
next morning&rsquo;s departure with Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife will be ready by seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the engineer
curtly informed them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all be leaving,
I assume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only War and Willie,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston told
him. &ldquo;The rest of us are sticking around for a few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes made no attempt to hide his displeasure.
&ldquo;You can do nothing here,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
you, if a ransom demand is made, I&rsquo;ll refer it to the
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feel better by staying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; Rhodes gave in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in the Scout camp once more, the Explorers
began to get ready for bed. War and Willie made a
last check of their belongings to be certain that
everything was in readiness for the early morning
departure.</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock, everyone had turned in for the
night. Jack, however, could not get to sleep. He
rolled and tossed, and finally arose and dressed.</p>
<p>Standing with his back to the tent, he studied the
sky. The night was cold but clear. Stars winked
overhead and a sliver of moon was rising above the
jagged mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Tossing wood on the fire, he ambled down the
path. The miner&rsquo;s huts were dark. In fact, the only
glow of light came from the engineer&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Turning in that direction, Jack approached the
building from the rear. A shade had been pulled
down, blocking the office window, but it gaped a
full inch at the bottom.</p>
<p>Jack glimpsed Rhodes and his wife inside the
inner office. Rhodes had opened the heavy door of
the big safe. As the Scout watched, he removed a
cardboard box.</p>
<p>No word was exchanged by the engineer and his
wife. Rhodes rolled the contents of the box out on
the table&mdash;a collection of emeralds so large that it
snatched Jack&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough wealth here to give us a new start
in the States,&rdquo; he heard the engineer say. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
intended to open the new vein until I was certain
Corning was safely out of the way. But with those
Scouts poking their noses in, I couldn&rsquo;t afford to
risk delay. I&rsquo;m depending upon you to get these
gems safely out, my dear. I&rsquo;ll follow within a few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Scouts may suspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t prove anything without Corning, and
they&rsquo;ll never find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the two that are accompanying me?&rdquo;
Mrs. Rhodes asked anxiously. &ldquo;If they learn about
these gems&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about those lads, my dear. They
have no reason to believe that you&rsquo;re carrying more
than the one sample to be assayed. Handle the
others in the usual way, and no one will suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him no thought, my dear. He will not
trouble you on the trail. I will see to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhodes answered. &ldquo;He
will betray you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stop worrying?&rdquo; her husband cut in
impatiently. &ldquo;Let me handle this end of it. Your job
is to get those gems through safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes replaced the empty cardboard box in the
safe. He blew out the light and the couple started
to leave together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Jack, fearful of being seen, quickly moved back
behind the rear building wall. His heart pounded
with excitement! He had seen and heard enough to
convince him that distrust of the engineer was well
founded!</p>
<p>Obviously, Rhodes was scheming to defraud the
mining company officials. Furthermore, his conversation
with his wife indicated that he was in close
touch with Carlos, the bandit!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 22</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ORDERS FROM BOGOTA</span></h2>
<p>From his hiding place, Jack watched Rhodes and
his wife walk to the cottage. Taking leave of Mrs.
Rhodes at the doorstep, the engineer went directly
to a supply shed nearby.</p>
<p>Presently he emerged with an unlighted lantern.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused. When Rhodes took
the trail leading away from the mining camp, he
followed at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The engineer did not go far. Leaving the well-defined
path, he made his way to a projecting, flat
rock which gave a clear view of the valley below.</p>
<p>Jack guessed that the man intended to signal, and
he was right.</p>
<p>Rhodes lighted the lantern. Uneasily, the engineer
glanced about. No sound had given warning that
Jack crouched behind the bushes, yet the man
seemed to sense that he was not alone. However,
after carefully surveying the area close by, he
slowly began to move the lighted lantern back and
forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>After awhile, he set it down on a rock and waited.
From his hiding place, Jack could not see below the
ridge. He knew, however, from Rhodes&rsquo; reaction,
that no answering signal had been received.</p>
<p>After perhaps ten minutes, the engineer repeated
the lantern signals. Again he failed to obtain answering
flashes.</p>
<p>After another long wait, the man tried a third
time. The valley below remained dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid fool!&rdquo; Rhodes muttered, losing patience.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he see my signal? Or has something gone
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angrily, the engineer extinguished the lantern
and left the high rock. Jack saw him retrace his way
to the cottage. A moment later, the light went out,
telling him that Rhodes had gone to bed.</p>
<p>Satisfied that he could learn no more by remaining
abroad, Jack ambled back to camp. To his surprise,
he found Mr. Livingston up and dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; the Scout leader greeted him
in relief. &ldquo;I discovered you were gone, and I was
worried. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Jack explained. &ldquo;Lucky too, I
guess, because while I was prowling around, I
picked up some useful information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then related to Mr. Livingston the entire conversation
he had overheard between Rhodes and
his wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;That confirms what we have suspected,&rdquo; the
Scout leader nodded. &ldquo;Rhodes must know what became
of Corning! That raid Carlos pulled off probably
was a phony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Rhodes arranged it? He hired
Carlos to get rid of your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t, Jack, at least he&rsquo;s making no honest
effort to ransom Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning may not be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to take any view except that he is being
held for ransom, Jack. Carlos is a cunning fellow.
Even if he did team up with Rhodes, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
to his advantage to do away with Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes hinted as
much when she told her husband she was afraid of
treachery. Carlos may try to play both sides! But
why doesn&rsquo;t he show his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re staying here and I&rsquo;m sending
War and Willie with Mrs. Rhodes. Sooner or later,
Carlos will make a demand, I believe. I don&rsquo;t trust
Rhodes. So I want to be here when it comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the gems Mrs. Rhodes will be carrying?
Shall we let her get away with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theoretically, as the wife of Rhodes, she&rsquo;d be
acting as his agent. If she delivers the emeralds to
the company office, we have no complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but that&rsquo;s not the plan,&rdquo; Jack protested.
&ldquo;She intends to get them through, but for her own
and her husband&rsquo;s use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tip Willie and War to what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston decided. &ldquo;They can keep an eye on
Mrs. Rhodes, and turn her in, if she doesn&rsquo;t deliver
the gems. Now get some sleep, Jack. Tomorrow may
be a hard day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn the next morning, Willie and
War set off with Mrs. Rhodes on the difficult trip
back to Bogota.</p>
<p>Aloof as always, the engineer&rsquo;s wife coldly ignored
her Scout escorts. She carried a minimum of
personal luggage, but had provided herself with a
more than generous supply of food, including a basket
of bananas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she take bananas?&rdquo; Willie demanded
in an undertone to Jack, just prior to the start down
the lonely mountain trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got me!&rdquo; Jack replied with a shrug. &ldquo;Seems
to me that back at Santa Marta, she said she disliked
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! But she&rsquo;s got some reason for carrying
&rsquo;em. Mrs. Rhodes never does anything without
a reason. Say, I got a hunch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; remained unrevealed, for the caravan
had started to move away. Mr. Livingston addressed
a quiet word of warning to Willie as they
shook hands in farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underrate Mrs. Rhodes,&rdquo; he told the Scout.
&ldquo;And keep an alert watch for Carlos. I doubt he&rsquo;ll
make any trouble, but he might try to hold up your
party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure be glad to get to Bogota,&rdquo; Willie sighed.
&ldquo;I got an uneasy feeling about this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Scouts and Mrs. Rhodes had departed,
the camp resumed its usual routine of work. Mr.
Rhodes, in a driving mood, assigned miners across
the river to the newly opened pit. However, he
would not permit Jack, Ken, Phillipe or Mr. Livingston
to visit the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sore because we discovered the old vein,&rdquo;
Ken asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than that,&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
accumulating emeralds fast, and he doesn&rsquo;t want us
to know the extent of his haul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days elapsed. The weather was unpleasantly
cold and the Explorers found it difficult to keep
comfortably warm in their tents.</p>
<p>Rhodes, though he now lived alone in the cottage,
did not invite Mr. Livingston, Ken and Jack to
move in with him. They were too proud to make the
request.</p>
<p>The mining engineer worked hard. He was up
before dawn and at the new emerald vein soon after
breakfast. There he remained for the greater part
of the day. Upon his return each night, he locked
the diggings in the big office safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>During the engineer&rsquo;s absence from camp, Jack
and Ken made leisurely inspections of the office and
even the cottage. Rhodes however, had anticipated
the investigation and if any evidence existed, carefully
had destroyed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hold out here much longer,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
remarked on the afternoon of the third day.
&ldquo;Our supplies are running low. Rhodes might let
us have what we need from the company stores, but
I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather starve than go begging to him!&rdquo; Ken
asserted. &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s happened to Willie and
War?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long, hard trip to Bogota,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; Ken nodded. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do the best
they can. But it&rsquo;s hard waiting&mdash;especially with
nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day wore on with the Scouts becoming increasingly
restless. They yearned for action. Anything,
it seemed to Ken and Jack, would be better
than to remain inactive, merely waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we just had some idea where to search for
Corning,&rdquo; Jack fretted. &ldquo;As it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing heavy footsteps, he did not finish what
he had intended to say. Rhodes strode into camp.
He had fully recovered now from his accident, save
that his arm remained in a sling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The engineer directed himself to Mr. Livingston,
who was occupied writing in a daily journal which
he kept. Expectantly, the Scouts gathered close,
wondering what had brought Rhodes. He did not
waste words in informing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just received a message from the company,&rdquo;
the engineer asserted. &ldquo;My wife reached Bogota
and had the sample assayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard so soon?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked in
astonishment. &ldquo;We saw no one arrive here at the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The messenger came and departed a few minutes
ago. My orders are to close the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To close it!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston echoed incredulously.
&ldquo;In view of the new discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pit is not worth the expense involved. Your
sample assayed as practically worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be! That emerald looked flawless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emeralds are deceptive. I admit I was deceived
myself as to its value. But my orders are definite.
The vein must be sealed, and the mine closed no
later than tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, I&rsquo;ll have to obey orders. I&rsquo;ll dismiss
the miners tonight and join my wife in Bogota.
You&rsquo;ll have to leave in the morning. I advise an early
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scout leader made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; Rhodes said sharply. &ldquo;This is
not a bluff. The mine will be shut down tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>After Rhodes had gone, he and the two Scouts
discussed the predicament in which they now found
themselves. They were reluctant to leave the mine
with Corning missing, and word expected momentarily
from Willie and War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Rhodes is just pulling another trick to
get us out of here,&rdquo; Ken suggested. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we
defy him and stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our supplies are nearly gone,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
reminded him. &ldquo;Once the mine closes, the camp
likely will be looted by hill bandits or the dismissed
miners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos might show up here,&rdquo; Jack suggested. &ldquo;If
so, we might make a deal with him, or pry out of
him what became of Mr. Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston answered, &ldquo;but
it seems too risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure funny that Rhodes would get word back
so fast from Bogota,&rdquo; Ken muttered. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
heard anything, and our boys were to have chartered
a plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Rhodes is lying,&rdquo; Jack stated flatly. &ldquo;Oh,
he may close the mine as he threatens, but I can&rsquo;t
believe that emerald we sent to Bogota was worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s just scared and intends to pull out,&rdquo;
Ken speculated. &ldquo;That strikes me as more likely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The discussion continued for some little time. It
ended by Mr. Livingston advising the Scouts to
pack up their belongings and equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be ready for an early start from here in the
morning,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to go, if we
change our minds. But we&rsquo;ll be set, and Rhodes will
assume that we intend to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack began to pack the items which would not be
needed that night. The task finished, he set off to fill
the canteens with fresh water from a nearby spring.</p>
<p>Passing the office and cottage, he noted that both
appeared deserted. Rhodes was not to be seen anywhere
in camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably across the river again,&rdquo; Jack reflected.</p>
<p>A faint humming sound overhead, caused the
Scout to halt abruptly. Shading his eyes from the
lowering sun, he scanned the sky.</p>
<p>At first he could see nothing. Then, with a pounding
pulse, he observed a moving speck against the
blue. An airplane!</p>
<p>Jack glued his eyes upon the craft, scarcely daring
to hope. Could it be Willie and War obeying Mr.
Livingston&rsquo;s instructions to survey the forest area?
The plane was a long distance away, flying straight
north over the sea of trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Jack dropped the canteens and raced back to find
Mr. Livingston and Ken. The pair joined him on the
path, having themselves heard the hum of the
distant motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Willie and War!&rdquo; the Scout leader
asserted jubilantly. &ldquo;I knew I could depend on them!
But why don&rsquo;t they fly over the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For twenty minutes the watchers caught tantalizing
glimpses of the plane. At times it passed beyond
their line of vision, being hidden by the mountain
ridges or the clouds.</p>
<p>Then, as the trio became more impatient, Jack
noted that the craft had turned toward Emerald
Valley once more. This time, the plane came steadily
on, flying directly in a line with the mining camp.</p>
<p>Drawing close, it dropped lower and began to
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Willie and War all right!&rdquo; Ken chortled.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably drop a message because they
can&rsquo;t hope to land. I hope they&rsquo;ve picked up some
information that&rsquo;s worth while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane circled three times. Mr. Livingston and
the Scouts signaled their readiness to receive a
message.</p>
<p>At length the cylinder was dropped. It flashed
down, but was caught in a strong gust of wind, and
deflected from its target. Jack saw it fall into a
clump of bushes near the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Even as he and Ken started off to retrieve the
cylinder, Rhodes came hurriedly across the bridge.
From the grim expression of his face and his manner
of walking, the Scouts instantly knew that he
had seen the cylinder dropped from the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston urged the two Explorers.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him see that message. If he gets it, all
our plans will be ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 23</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TRAILING RHODES</span></h2>
<p>Scrambling over rocks and through a tangle of
vines and bush, the two Scouts sought to obtain the
cylinder before the mining engineer could do so.</p>
<p>At the risk of a bad fall, Jack half slid down a
steep slope. The cylinder had tumbled into a crevice
but he retrieved it before Rhodes could get there.</p>
<p>There was no opportunity to examine the message.
In a matter of moments, Rhodes had joined
him, moving cautiously because of his useless arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have that cylinder!&rdquo; the engineer ordered.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. Turning his back, he started
to climb the rocks to rejoin Ken on a ledge above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends dropped a message!&rdquo; Rhodes accused.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working with them to make it hard
for me here! What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack still made no answer. He climbed steadily,
handing the cylinder up to Ken who passed it on to
Mr. Livingston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Impeded by his injured arm, Rhodes had to climb
very slowly. While Ken and Mr. Livingston went to
their camp with the retrieved cylinder, he waited
to give the engineer a helping hand up the steepest
part of the slope. Rhodes did not thank him.</p>
<p>Instead, the engineer gazed at the youth with
undisguised hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your friends have ruined me here!&rdquo; he
asserted wrathfully. &ldquo;Except for you, everything
would have gone off well. What was the reason for
that plane circling this camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s answer was a smile and a shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, don&rsquo;t answer!&rdquo; Rhodes snapped. &ldquo;But
if you think you&rsquo;ve won this little game, you have
another guess coming! I might have helped you find
Corning. Now I&rsquo;ll never do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, the engineer strode off to the cottage.</p>
<p>Jack quickly joined Mr. Livingston and Ken at
the tent camp. The other two had opened the cylinder
and already were scanning the somewhat
lengthy message from Ken and Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it aloud,&rdquo; Jack urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston agreed. &ldquo;Rhodes isn&rsquo;t
sneaking up here to listen, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to the cottage in a dreadful fury,&rdquo; Jack
answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for him though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston began to read slowly so that every
word of the message could be grasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald sample assayed. Highly favorable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highly favorable!&rdquo; Ken broke in excitedly. &ldquo;Then
Rhodes lied again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Mr. Livingston nodded and read on: &ldquo;Mrs.
Rhodes tried several tricks, substituting poor grade
emeralds for one of top quality. Certain she is
teamed up with Ferd Baronni on deal to defraud
company. We went over their heads and got the
emerald sample to higher officials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lads!&rdquo; Jack chuckled. &ldquo;I knew we could
depend on &rsquo;em. What else do they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston continued to read: &ldquo;Only visible
habitation in mine area a group of huts above Emerald
Valley. This may be bandit hide-out. Returning
to Bogota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A map had been included with the hastily
scrawled message. Studying it, Mr. Livingston and
the Scouts estimated that the cluster of huts might
be about seven miles from the mining camp in the
more rugged area.</p>
<p>A portion of the way could be traveled by means
of the narrow trail which gave access to the outside
world. But to reach the hide-out, if such it was,
would require a hard trek over a bisecting path in a
densely overgrown area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie and War have done their part well,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston asserted. &ldquo;Now the rest is up to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get in there,&rdquo; Jack urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
cinch we&rsquo;ve learned all we can here. No use hanging
on even another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Ken demanded, eager to be
off. &ldquo;Right away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well,&rdquo; the Scout leader nodded. &ldquo;We
can let Rhodes assume we&rsquo;re starting for Bogota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about taking Phillipe along?&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, if you can persuade him,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
nodded. &ldquo;With the camp here closing down, he
should be willing to come with us, and he&rsquo;ll be
useful. See what you can do, while Ken and I round
up the mules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack found Phillipe in his shack, sharing a meal
with his family. However, nothing he could say
would induce the miner to become a member of the
exploring party. Firmly, the man rejected an offer
of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, I am not a coward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I would
not face Carlos in his own lair! No, Senor. You are
very brave to attempt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Discouraged by his failure to interest Phillipe in
the expedition, Jack started back to the tent camp.</p>
<p>In passing the little office, he heard someone
stirring around inside, and impulsively opened the
door and peered in.</p>
<p>Rhodes was in the inner room, beside the safe.
For a moment he did not hear or see the youth. The
engineer was deeply engrossed in emptying the
vault of valuables, including the little box of newly
mined emeralds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the vein has been producing?&rdquo; Jack remarked
to draw the man&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Rhodes whirled around, thrusting the emeralds
into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These samples are worthless,&rdquo; he muttered, his
eyes smoldering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why bother to take them with you? You
are leaving, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Rhodes returned with a sneer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
shaking the dust of this mine from my feet forever.
Why should I worry what becomes of the place or
whether bandits take over as soon as I&rsquo;ve cleared
out? Why should I worry about the company? Did
it ever do anything for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to Bogota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am! I&rsquo;ll be away from here within the hour, to
join my wife. I hope I never see you or the lousy
place again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not forgetting that he&rsquo;s still missing? A
prisoner probably of the bandit, Carlos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corning is nothing to me, and I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you so! Didn&rsquo;t he set himself up here as engineer
in my place? He made me look bad to the
company&mdash;convinced them that I was stealing half
the emeralds that were mined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I could salvage anything for myself, I&rsquo;d be
entitled to it,&rdquo; Rhodes retorted. &ldquo;I gave the best
years of my life to the company for very little return.
I&rsquo;m fed up! I&rsquo;m getting out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you leave, why not tell us what really
became of Corning?&rdquo; Jack urged earnestly.</p>
<p>Rhodes slammed the safe door shut and turned
slowly to face the Scout. For just an instant, Jack
was hopeful that the engineer meant to make a full
revelation of the facts. Then, the man&rsquo;s mood
changed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you exactly what happened,&rdquo; Rhodes
said shortly. &ldquo;Carlos raided the place and took Corning
as hostage. There&rsquo;s been no ransom demand, so
I assume your friend is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Livingston never will be satisfied unless we
establish the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go ahead if he wants to,&rdquo; Rhodes
shrugged. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s stopping him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know this country well. You could help us
if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading for Bogota to join my wife! Nothing
will make me change my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least tell us where Carlos has his hide-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. He shifts from place
to place. To find Carlos would be very much like
chasing a humming bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack realized that it was useless to try to obtain
the cooperation of the engineer. Giving up, he went
back to report to Mr. Livingston and Ken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost certain he&rsquo;s made a big haul of emeralds
and is taking the pile to Bogota for his own
use,&rdquo; he concluded his account. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?
Try to stop him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s armed,&rdquo; the Scout leader pointed out. &ldquo;Besides,
we have no absolute proof that he won&rsquo;t turn
the gems over to Baronni when he reaches the
home office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll return to Bogota with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with him, Jack. We&rsquo;ll trail along behind to
see if we can find that village Willie and War spotted
from the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts resumed their packing. Long before
they had finished, they saw Rhodes ride away from
camp, carrying only the necessities of the trail.</p>
<p>After giving the engineer a little start, the Scouts
followed. Burdened by camping equipment, they
fell farther and farther back. As dusk approached,
they began to feel uneasy lest they lose him entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to make camp after dark,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said. &ldquo;On the other hand, if Rhodes can
press on, I guess we can too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to make time, the Scouts did not halt to
cook supper. Instead, they ate cold snacks as they
jogged on over the uneven trail. Presently, they
gained on Rhodes and in the gathering darkness
dimly could make out his figure ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>The party approached the bisecting path which
Willie and War had marked on their crude map
dropped from the plane. Mr. Livingston was consulting
it with a shielded flashlight, when Jack, who
was leading, suddenly halted his mule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Ken demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes is at the trail junction!&rdquo; Jack informed
him in a whisper. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong! I think he&rsquo;s
been held up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Held up!&rdquo; Ken echoed, peering ahead. &ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the bushes on the trail some distance below
them, a dapper little man had emerged. By his body
build, the Scouts were sure that it was Carlos, the
bandit. Though they could not see plainly, they
knew that the man must have the engineer covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been detected yet,&rdquo; Jack warned in
a whisper. &ldquo;Those sharp bends in the trail protected
us from view. Let&rsquo;s see what happens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts could hear heated conversation in
Spanish and Rhodes&rsquo; violent protests. But they were
to no avail. The engineer was forced to dismount
and set his mule free. Carlos then ordered him to
start afoot ahead of him up the steep bisecting trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; Jack muttered. &ldquo;Rhodes a
captive! What do we do? Try to rescue him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth the trouble,&rdquo; Ken said in disgust.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston, however, had another opinion.
&ldquo;Evidently, Rhodes is being taken to the bandit
village,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;The one Willie and
War spotted. This, I think, is our chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;To trace Corning?&rdquo; supplied Jack.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston nodded as he dismounted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to rescue Rhodes, but there&rsquo;s no great hurry.
Let&rsquo;s follow Carlos and his captive for awhile, and
learn where the trail leads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 24</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Leaving their mules at the trail entrance, the
Scouts plodded up the narrow, rocky path in the
wake of Rhodes and Carlos. Fearful of losing the
pair in the darkness, they kept as close as they
dared.</p>
<p>The going was hard. But after more than a half
hour&rsquo;s struggle over tree roots and creepers, the
path widened a bit. A short distance farther on, the
trees suddenly opened up into a small clearing.</p>
<p>Peering cautiously down, the Scouts made out a
cluster of seven thatched huts scattered over a small
area. A camp fire burned brightly in the center of
the little village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the bandit hide-out, all right,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
asserted. &ldquo;But why has Carlos brought
Rhodes here? If robbery were the motive, he could
have accomplished it with less trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to sneak down there to see what I can
learn?&rdquo; Jack offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Jack promised. &ldquo;Wait here for
me. If I need help, I&rsquo;ll whistle. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll
know I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Learn what you can and report back,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
advised. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any unnecessary
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack slipped away in the darkness, avoiding the
open clearing. Keeping low, he circled until he came
out directly behind a thatched hut. Peering cautiously
in, he saw that it was deserted.</p>
<p>A man with long, shaggy black hair came out of
one of the buildings, a bush knife swinging from his
leather belt. Jack drew back and waited until he had
moved out of view. Then, making certain that no
one else was about, he crept stealthily on toward
the doorway of a larger hut.</p>
<p>Only a dim light burned inside. It gave forth
enough illumination however, for Jack to discern the
figures of Rhodes and the bandit.</p>
<p>They were seated opposite each other at a crudely
made wooden table. The bandit seemed in an ugly
mood, for he spoke in a loud voice, his talk an incoherent
mixture of Spanish and English.</p>
<p>At first, crouching against the flimsy wall, Jack
could not gain the conversation&rsquo;s drift. But he saw
Rhodes lay several bills on the table in front of
Carlos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will pay you well for your work, Carlos,&rdquo;
the engineer said. &ldquo;Believe me, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to
give you the slip. You&rsquo;d have had your pay for getting
rid of Corning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>With gesture of contempt, Carlos brushed the
money aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not enough, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwillingly, Rhodes laid two more bills on the
pile.</p>
<p>Carlos sneered at him. &ldquo;Senor, you are very rich.
I am very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes shoved back his chair, getting to his feet.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can blackmail me, Carlos!&rdquo; he
said sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid you too much now. What
you do with Corning is nothing to me&mdash;nothing!
I&rsquo;m leaving this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Senor,&rdquo; Carlos corrected softly. &ldquo;Not
until you pay. Money is no good. I will take the
emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are none. The mine has played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take Carlos to be a stupid fool? Senor, my
men have watched. You have mined many gems and
you carry them with you. Give them to me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy, Carlos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor would like to have me tell what I know?
That it was you who planned the little raid? That it
was the Senor who ordered Corning kidnapped and
put to death? Carlos much too smart to obey orders.
Corning more valuable to Carlos alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dirty blackmailer!&rdquo; Rhodes accused.
&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t get by with it, because it means
nothing to me whether Corning is dead or alive.
I&rsquo;m leaving the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Senor stay with Carlos until he hand over the
emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his uninjured hand, Rhodes drew for a revolver
secreted at his waist. Carlos was much quicker.
His shot winged the engineer in the fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try that again, Senor, and I shoot to kill,&rdquo; Carlos
warned. He spoke in Spanish and Jack did not
catch the words that followed.</p>
<p>But he saw the bandit confiscate the weapon,
which he recognized as his own. It was the automatic
Jack had taken from Carlos, and that later
had disappeared from the Scout tent.</p>
<p>Rhodes sagged back into a chair, nursing his
wounded hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gems,&rdquo; Carlos reminded him.</p>
<p>When Rhodes made no move to hand them over,
the bandit tore a small pouch from the leather belt
beneath the engineer&rsquo;s shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to half the emeralds,&rdquo; Rhodes
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you brought me here? You are a worse
rascal than I knew! Now that you have stripped
me clean, release me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Senor,&rdquo; the bandit said in his silken voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game, Carlos? You have the gems.
What more do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife, she loves you, eh? She will pay well
to see you again. No?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Rhodes will now go to see his old friend,
Senor Corning,&rdquo; the bandit chuckled. &ldquo;You two
have much to talk over. Go, Senor! Walk ahead of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack pulled back behind the hut only a moment
before the strutting little bandit marched Rhodes
out into the open. The engineer was forced to enter
another hut at the far end of the village, one
guarded by two natives armed with knives and guns.</p>
<p>Making no attempt to approach the prison hut,
Jack rejoined his companions and made a terse
report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes got what he deserved,&rdquo; he informed the
group. &ldquo;Apparently, Carlos has tossed him in with
Corning. The hut is well guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many in camp?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw four men. There must be others. We&rsquo;re
outnumbered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our only hope of getting Corning out of
that hole is to start a diversion,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might fire one of the huts,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of them empty?&rdquo; the Scout leader asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of &rsquo;em appeared to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wild scheme,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said dubiously.
&ldquo;But it might work. If it shouldn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d likely
wind up prisoners of Carlos.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it,&rdquo; Jack urged. &ldquo;If we can free Corning,
we&rsquo;ll have another helper. Two, if we count
Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After discussing the plan in detail, a decision was
made that Ken should remain behind. He was instructed
that if the rescue scheme miscarried, he
was to escape at once and try to seek help at the
closest village or Bogota.</p>
<p>Details arranged, Jack and Mr. Livingston slipped
quietly down to the hut village.</p>
<p>Unable to get close to the cottage where Rhodes
and Corning were imprisoned, the pair spotted a hut
some distance away. It was empty, and apparently
had not been used in many weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had some gasoline,&rdquo; Jack muttered.
&ldquo;That would send her up in a flash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston instructed Jack to set a series of
fires in the straw along the back wall.</p>
<p>Swiftly, they both worked. Once they were assured
that the empty building was well afire, they
crept through the darkness toward the rear of the
guarded prison hut.</p>
<p>For awhile, nothing happened. Then as the roof
straw began to blaze, the attention of one of the
guards suddenly was attracted. With a wild yell,
he alerted his companion.</p>
<p>Leaving the other alone to guard the hut, he
rushed toward the flaming building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our only chance!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston whispered.
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>He and Jack crept through the darkness. The
guard did not hear nor see them, for his eyes were
upon the blazing hut some distance away.</p>
<p>Before he was aware of danger, the two were
upon him. They tackled hard, and with only a grunt
of surprise, he went down.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston wrested the gun from his hand,
while Jack seized the knife. A handkerchief was
stuffed into his mouth.</p>
<p>Leaving Mr. Livingston to hold the guard at bay
with his own weapon, Jack rushed into the hut.
Rhodes was there, his hands now tied behind his
back.</p>
<p>Another man, whom the Scout took to be Corning,
also had his hands bound. He lay upon a heap of
straw, face unshaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Corning?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the quick answer. &ldquo;Untie me, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack slashed the cords which held the engineer&rsquo;s
hands. He was tempted to ignore Rhodes, but a
realization of the fate that awaited the man if he
were left behind, softened him. A quick thrust of
the knife, and he too was free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Make for the trail!&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Ken is
waiting there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes started off at a run. Corning would not
abandon his rescuers. He helped Mr. Livingston tie
up the guard. Then with Jack and the Scout leader,
he made a fast break for the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>As they struggled up the incline, a shout arose
from the direction of the blazing hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen us!&rdquo; Corning cried. &ldquo;Go on! I&rsquo;ll try
to hold &rsquo;em while you get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack seized his arm, pulling him along. &ldquo;No one
stays behind,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several shots were fired. Ignoring them, and
crouching low, the two ran for the trees. In the darkness,
the bandits could not see their targets. All
shots went wide of the mark.</p>
<p>Breathless from exertion, Corning and Jack
reached the trail where Ken nervously waited.
Rhodes already was plunging down the path in fast
retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Hap?&rdquo; Jack demanded anxiously. &ldquo;He
was with us until a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the Scout leader came crushing through
the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a swarm of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he reported tersely.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hot after us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four quickly caught up with Rhodes who was
in a near panic. Slipping and sliding, they made
no attempt to move quietly as they crashed along
the narrow, treacherous trail.</p>
<p>After awhile, Jack wheeled up for a moment to
listen. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re drawing in close!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Maybe
we ought to make a stand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Rhodes. &ldquo;Keep on! If we can make
the trail junction, we can stop those devils!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;How? With our fists? We have no ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes&rsquo; laughter had a wild ring. &ldquo;Ammunition!&rdquo;
he chortled. &ldquo;If we can get to the junction, I&rsquo;ll supply
you with enough to blow Carlos to kingdom
come! Steal from me, will he? I&rsquo;ll show that blackguard
he&rsquo;s dealing with McClellan Rhodes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 25</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GOING HOME</span></h2>
<p>At the union of the trails, the Scouts and the two
engineers elected to make their stand against the
bandits.</p>
<p>In a frenzy of excitement, Rhodes led the others
to a rock cavity where he had cached a supply of
dynamite. He had hidden it there weeks before,
intending to use it in an emergency if his plot to
gain possession of the Last Chance mine failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dynamite the path ahead of Carlos!&rdquo; Rhodes
shouted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be trapped behind the rock slide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming fast,&rdquo; the other engineer warned.
&ldquo;Get busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dynamite was planted with its fuse ready to
light. But Rhodes deliberately delayed setting it off.
Corning spoke sharply to him, saying he would be
no party to a massacre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That demon has the emeralds,&rdquo; Rhodes muttered.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a traitor. I want to finish him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set off the charge,&rdquo; Corning ordered. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlos and his men still were a considerable distance
away.</p>
<p>Rhodes hesitated, but realized that his will was
not to prevail. With a shrug he lighted the fuse and
everyone rushed for cover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>The minutes of waiting seemed endless. As the
explosion failed to materialize, Rhodes began to
fret and worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dynamite was stored too long,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I was afraid it had lost its juice. I&rsquo;m going
to take a look. The fuse may have gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corning hauled him back to cover. Scarcely thirty
seconds elapsed when a terrific explosion shook the
earth.</p>
<p>Jack, Ken and Mr. Livingston flattened themselves,
face downward. Even so, they were showered
with dirt and chips of rock.</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, Corning and Rhodes
went to investigate. They returned to report jubilantly
that tons of rock now blocked the path giving
access to Carlos&rsquo; hide-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his men are trapped back there in the
hills,&rdquo; Corning told the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no way out for them?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, unless they climb down the cliffs. If I
know Carlos, he will not attempt it. We&rsquo;ll send the
authorities, who at their leisure can reopen the
passage. By that time, I imagine Carlos no longer
will be in a belligerent mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhodes?&rdquo; Jack questioned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done
about him? He plotted to put himself back at the
mine in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the engineer replied. &ldquo;Carlos told me
the whole sordid story while I was his captive.
Rhodes is greedy, and for years, before I took over
at Emerald Valley, he milked the mine for his own
benefit. Even so, I feel sorry for the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t aim to let him escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Corning answered after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll take him on to Bogota
and let company officials decide what&rsquo;s to be done.
As for myself, I&rsquo;m willing to forget the foul trick he
played on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the lost emeralds? Carlos robbed
Rhodes of a small fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may get them back,&rdquo; Corning said, undisturbed.
&ldquo;With the path blocked, Carlos isn&rsquo;t going
anywhere. If the authorities will back me up, I&rsquo;ll
return here with a posse and force the bandits to
give up the gems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be left many days without someone in
charge. I&rsquo;ll see the party safely to Bogota, and get
back to my post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided. That very night, the Scouts
pushed on, accompanied by Rhodes, who surprisingly
offered no resistance. With the loss of the
emeralds, all the spirit and fight seemed to have left
him. He and Corning talked together almost as
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I resented it because the company put you in
charge,&rdquo; Rhodes told the other. &ldquo;I figured you were
a greenhorn and I could get rid of you without
much trouble. So I hooked up with Carlos, paying
him to stage a fake raid and haul you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where your plan backfired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Carlos double-crossed me as I might have
expected. He kept demanding more money, threatening
to release you and tell all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw you flashing signals down the mountain,&rdquo;
Ken commented, entering the conversation.
&ldquo;You were communicating with Carlos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We had worked out a crude code
system. It never was very effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos took you by surprise today on the trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with a little luck, I&rsquo;d have made it to Bogota
with the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving Mr. Corning to his fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes flushed, ashamed to have his intentions
so openly discussed. He fell into a morose silence,
making no further attempt to act friendly.</p>
<p>On the trail, Mr. Corning and Mr. Livingston had
ample opportunity to renew their old friendship.
The engineer explained that he had urged the Scout
leader to come to Emerald Valley in the hope of
forestalling the very situation which had developed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlos has been terrorizing these hills for years,&rdquo;
he informed his friend. &ldquo;I suspected that Rhodes
was stirring things up a bit, but I never had proof.
That was one reason I sent for you. I figured you
could help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That vein should establish the Last Chance on
a highly productive basis again,&rdquo; Mr. Corning asserted.
&ldquo;Operations should remain profitable for
many years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Rhodes talked very little during the tedious
journey back to civilization. He admitted however,
that he had ordered his workmen to weaken the log
bridge so that the Scouts would be stranded across
the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured you would find the vein,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready to start mining operations until I
had made certain Corning wouldn&rsquo;t come back to
plague me. So I figured I could keep you tied up
across the river for a day or so until I could make
my plans. It didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your wife teamed with Ferd Baronni to
get a cut on all the emeralds mined under your direction?&rdquo;
Jack probed. &ldquo;That is, you saw to it that
a certain percentage of them never went through to
company officials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes would make no admission implicating
either his wife or the company agent.</p>
<p>However, the Scouts were determined to learn
the entire truth. Days later, in Bogota, after the
deposed mining engineer had been turned over to
company officials, they rejoined Willie and War who
assisted in piecing together the full story.</p>
<p>Lounging comfortably in a hotel room, the two
Scouts recounted their own unpleasant adventures
on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhodes gave us a rough time of it,&rdquo; War
told his friends. &ldquo;She tried to trick us about the
emerald. We knew she turned over a poor imitation
of the gem to company officials, but it took Willie
to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remembered that back in Santa Marta she told
us she disliked bananas,&rdquo; Willie related with a
chuckle. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why she carried a
sack of &rsquo;em with her when she left the mine. I tried
to take one from the bunch, and she set up an awful
yip. That started me to thinking. So, we mashed up
the bananas and found the prize emerald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d been carrying gems that way for quite a
while without being caught,&rdquo; War added. &ldquo;We
turned the good emerald over to company officials.
It&rsquo;s top grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you learn about Ferd Baronni?&rdquo; Ken
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s hooked up with Rhodes,&rdquo; War answered.
&ldquo;In checking the books, company auditors
found a lot of discrepancies. So Baronni&rsquo;s been
fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned too, that it was Baronni who hired
that sled-boat operator to try to delay our trip to
the mine,&rdquo; contributed Willie. &ldquo;He figured a big
dose of trouble would discourage us from going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due time, the Scouts met company officials and
learned first hand that Rhodes and his wife were to
be shipped out of the country. Company representatives,
grateful to the Explorers, also told them that
they were to enjoy a three weeks&rsquo; vacation at the
firm&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston and the Scouts were put up at
Bogota&rsquo;s best hotel. Sightseeing trips, deluxe food
and luxurious rooms were theirs at no cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Corning could not remain
with the party. Uneasy about the mine, he obtained
a posse and set off at once for Emerald Valley.</p>
<p>For more than a week, the Scouts received no
word. Then by messenger they were informed that
Carlos had been captured and the stolen emeralds
recovered. Mr. Corning notified them that he had
reopened the mine, and would resume operations at
the new site across the river.</p>
<p>The Scouts did not expect to see him again during
their stay in Colombia. Therefore, it came as a
pleasant surprise, when, three days before their
scheduled departure by plane for the States, the
engineer suddenly appeared at their hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let you fly off without saying goodbye,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;Not after all you did for me!
We&rsquo;re going to pack a lot of excitement into your
last few days here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer more than kept his word. He took
the Scouts everywhere and constantly delighted
them with new and interesting sights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this gay life keeps up much longer we&rsquo;ll be
softies,&rdquo; Jack asserted one afternoon on their final
day in Bogota. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been swell here, but I&rsquo;ve had
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; warbled Willie. &ldquo;Emerald hunting
is okay, but give me the USA.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know I catch myself thinking about that
nice quiet camping trip to Minnesota,&rdquo; admitted
War sheepishly. &ldquo;The one we always plan to take,
and never do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it yet,&rdquo; promised Mr. Livingston.
&ldquo;Next summer maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds great!&rdquo; approved Ken, stretching luxuriously
on the hotel sofa. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vacation without bandits might seem dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different anyhow,&rdquo; contributed War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; drawled Jack. &ldquo;All the same, it will
seem mighty good to open that old Post log book
again&mdash;to start once more where we left off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking of the reunion they would have with
their friends and fellow Scouts, the Explorers all
became silent. Two wonderful vacations in South
America had conditioned them to high adventure!
And even more was in store.</p>
